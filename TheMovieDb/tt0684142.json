They go on about trying to survive the next two years there as we fade into ... Two Days Earlier:  From where we left off, Lister, Kochanski, Cat and Kryten are dressed up as the Dibbley family and making their escape. What they don't know is that they are hooked up to a VR suite and all of this is a simulation.  They climb aboard a Blue Midget, which is very different to what we have seen before. It is now a large vehicle which stands upright on two massive legs. After a fabulous display from the Cat where he tap dances with the Midget, they make their escape.  Rimmer gets to the VR suite and types a command to erase any references to the deal he and Lister made.  Suddenly the scene aboard the Blue Midget cuts to erase several words and it looks like a bad editing job.  After several moments of jumping around they realise they are in VR.","id":421340,"production_code":null,"season_number":8,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
