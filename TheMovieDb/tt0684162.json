The male inmates want him to sneak in a camera and film them but he refuses.  Kill Crazy and some other inmates reprogram him, turning him into a ruthless entrepreneur and he creates \"Krytie TV\", a pay-per-view service offering \"Women's Shower Night\" and other events.  Lister tries to get Kryten to stop, as he and Rimmer are in the middle of an appeal against their sentences, but Kryten plays a trick on them, getting them to mistakenly trash Ackerman's quarters live on Krytie TV.","id":421341,"production_code":null,"season_number":8,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
