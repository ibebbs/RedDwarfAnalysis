His new existence isn’t entirely lonely: also aboard are cowardly hologram Arnold J Rimmer, the ship’s senile computer Holly, and an evolved, self-absorbed descendant of his pet cat. Unfortunately, there’s little left to do in the universe but bicker with his unlikely new friends, make a pig sty out of his bunk and, unwittingly, eat the powdered remains of his former crewmates.","id":421377,"production_code":null,"season_number":1,"still_path":null,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
