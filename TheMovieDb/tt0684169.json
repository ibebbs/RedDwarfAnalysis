In this reality, Lister is a beer-swilling tomboy, Rimmer a stilted female bureaucrat, and the Cat, to the horror of his visiting alter-ego, is a dog. In a night they’ll all regret, the crews mingle, the drink starts flowing and one thing leads to another, the repercussions for Lister being unnaturally severe.","id":421332,"production_code":null,"season_number":2,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
