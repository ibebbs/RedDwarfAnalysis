They demonstrate it on the last strawberry in the universe and recieve two exact copies. Lister samples one and reels from the taste, saying that it is brilliant, so succulent and divine. He tries the other and scrunches his face in disgust as we see that there are maggots crawling around in it.    Kryten notes that the triplicator has put all the best qualities in one copy and the worst in the other. Lister attempts to reverse the process but causes an overload and Red Dwarf blows up. After the blast, they realise that they accidentally triplicated Red Dwarf and there are two copies left behind.    The crew board the \"\"High\"\" ship to find their counterparts are monks and are all into the better side of things: spiritual happiness etc. Kryten finds half of the triplicator he needs to merge the ships to get the original back.    They board the \"\"Low\"\" ship and it is horrible, the crew are monsters and","id":421370,"production_code":null,"season_number":5,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
