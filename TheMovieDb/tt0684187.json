With the aid of the infuriating Talkie Toaster, whose questions about life, the universe and everything invariably gravitate towards bread, the crew devises a solution, unaware that a nearby \"white hole\" is disrupting the passage of time. Alarmingly, it falls to Lister's contested pool-playing skills to put everything back in order.","id":421421,"production_code":null,"season_number":4,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
