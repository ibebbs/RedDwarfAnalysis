1,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"To Gannymede and Titan, yes sir, I've been around..."
1,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Lister."
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Huh?"
1,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Have you ever been hit over the head with a welding mallet?"
1,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"No? Stop that and push the trolley."
1,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Yes, sir, Rimmer!"
1,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Right. Corridor 159."
1,1,RIMMER,1.000000,"Lister, shut up!"
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"I'm only humming!"
1,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Well *don't*."
1,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Lister, don't hum and don't make any stupid sounds with your cheeks."
1,1,RIMMER,0.500000,"Lister, one more sound, anything, and you're on report, my laddo. What job number's this?"
1,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Right! That's it!  "Lister, D., Third Technician. Offense: obstructing a superior technician by humming, clicking, and being quiet." When the Captain sees this you're dead."
1,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Rimmer, I'm bored!"
1,1,RIMMER,-0.750000,"Bored?! This is essential routine maintenance! It's absolutely vital for the well-being of this crew, this mission, and this ship. "Dispenser 172: chicken soup nozzle clogged.""
1,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Pass me a 14B, Lister."
1,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Lister, is this a 14B? Does it look even *remotely* like a 14B?"
1,1,RIMMER,-0.666667,"*This* is a 14B, Lister. This is a 14F. Are you blind?!"
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Who cares?"
1,1,RIMMER,1.000000,"*I* care, Lister!"
1,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"It's *my* career, Lister. I'm the one who gets it in the neck if an officer comes along, orders chicken soup, and gets black currant cordial with blancmange and two creams and a sugar."
1,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Chicken soup."
1,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Yep. That's working."
1,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"It's stupid anyway, all this maintenance business. The only reason they don't give this job to the service robots is they've got a better union than us."
1,1,RIMMER,-0.400000,"Lister, that is absolute nonsense. Right. What's next? "Botanical gardens: faulty power circuit. In corridor 147: sticking door.""
1,1,LISTER,-0.666667,"It's true, you know, though, Rimmer. You rank below all four of those service robots. Even the one that's gone absolutely mad."
1,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Well, Lister, not for long, matey. Up, up, up! That's where I'm going!"
1,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"Not until you pass your engineer's exam. And you won't do that because you'll just go in there and flunk again."
1,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Lister, last time I only failed by the *narrowest* of narrow margins."
1,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"You what? You walked in there, wrote, "I am a fish," four hundred times, did a funny little dance, and fainted."
1,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"That's a total lie!"
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"No, it's not! Petersen told me."
1,1,RIMMER,-0.333333,""No, it's not! Petersen told me." Lister, if you must know, what I did was, I wrote a discourse on power circuits which was simply too *radical*, too *unconventional*, too *mould- breaking* for the examiners to accept."
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah. You said you were a fish."
1,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Is that a cigarette you're smoking, Lister?"
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"No, it's a chicken."
1,1,RIMMER,0.250000,"Right! You're on report. Two times in as many minutes, Lister! I don't know."
1,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Yes, sir."
1,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Yo, Todhunter, get down!"
1,1,RIMMER,1.000000,"Yes, sir!"
1,1,RIMMER,1.000000,"Yes, sir!"
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"I stood on his toe."
1,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Maliciously, and with intent to wound."
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"It was an accident!"
1,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Lister, I put it to you, how is it possible to stand on one small toe by accident? You didn't stand on my toe at all, you stood on my entire foot, thereby obstructing a superior technician in pursuit of vital duty."
1,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"But the vital duty was him going to snap my guitar in half!"
1,1,RIMMER,1.000000,"Whereupon you leapt from the top bunk onto the whole of my right foot."
1,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Had there been a crisis situation, Lister, I would have had to perform my duties hopping, clearly putting the ship at risk, clearly therefore mutiny."
1,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"However, I'm not a vindictive man, so I don't intend to apply for the death penalty."
1,1,LISTER,-0.666667,"You see, I try, sir. I'm not an insubordinate man by nature. I try and respect Rimmer and everything, but it's not easy, 'cause he's such a smeghead."
1,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Did you hear that, sir?  Lister, do you have any conception of the penalty for describing a superior technician as a smeghead?"
1,1,RIMMER,1.000000,"You heard that!  With respect, sir, your career's finished, Todhunter, you big lig!"
1,1,LISTER,1.000000,"There goes MacIntyre."
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Goodbye George."
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"That was George!"
1,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Really? I thought it was Mary Queen of Scots."
1,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Off!"
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Hey! I was watching that!"
1,1,RIMMER,1.000000,"Well, tough!"
1,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"You touch that guitar, Lister, I'll remove the E string and garrotte you with it."
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Can I do anything? Is it OK if I breathe? Can I breathe?"
1,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Lister, I have an exam tomorrow, which I intend to pass."
1,1,LISTER,0.500000,"I know, yeah. By cheating."
1,1,RIMMER,-0.666667,"This is not cheating! It's merely an aid to memory. Helps me marshal the facts already in my command."
1,1,LISTER,-0.333333,"What does? Copying the entire textbooks onto your body? Why don't you hand your body in and let them mark that?"
1,1,RIMMER,-0.250000,"Lister, do you think it's easy for someone like me to become an officer? Someone who wasn't Academy educated? Someone who didn't have the right nobby background? Someone who didn't have the right parents?"
1,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"You didn't have the right parents? Whose parents did you have?"
1,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"*My* parents. The wrong parents."
1,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"I'm just saying, you know, if you can't pass fair and square, why bother?"
1,1,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Well, you would, Lister, because you've got no ambition, no drive. You're perfectly content to be the lowest rank on the ship."
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"I'm not the lowest rank on this ship. What about the laboratory mice? I tell those mice to do something, they've got to jump to it. "Yes, sir, Mr Lister, sir! Eee, eee, eee, eee...""
1,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Lister, you are a nothing."
1,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"I'm not a nothing! I've got me plan."
1,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"What's that, the plan to be the slobbiest entity in the entire universe?"
1,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"No. Me five-year plan. You see, I'm going to do two more trips. And I've been saving up all me pay--"
1,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Since when?"
1,1,LISTER,-0.750000,"Since always. That's why I never buy any soap or deodorant or socks or anything like that, you know. Anyway, I'm going to buy meself a little farm on Fiji. And I'm going to get a sheep and a cow, and breed horses."
1,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"With a sheep and a cow?"
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"No, with horses and horses."
1,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"On Fiji?"
1,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"Yeah! The prices there are unbelievable."
1,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Yes, because they had a volcanic eruption and now most of Fiji's three feet below sea level!"
1,1,LISTER,-0.333333,"It's only three feet. They can wade. That's why the animals are gonna hafta be quite tall."
1,1,RIMMER,0.375000,"Nice plan, Lister. Excellent plan! Brilliant plan, Lister! What about the sheep? What are you going to do, buy them water-wings? Fit them with stilts? Better still, you could cross-breed them with dolphins and have leaping mutton.  Baa, splash, baa, splash."
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"You can get a drainage grant these days."
1,1,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Why bother, Lister? You could be the first man to produce wet- look knitwear."
1,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Look, this is why I never ever said anything to you, 'cause I knew you'd say something like this."
1,1,RIMMER,-0.250000,"Lister, you've got the brain of a cheese sandwich.  "Mornin', Farmer Lister! I'm just poppin' down to the shops in my submarine. Can I buy you anything?""
1,1,HOLLY,-0.500000,"The "Welcome Back George MacIntyre" reception is about to begin in the refectory. George says he'd like to invite everybody, especially those who weren't able to attend his funeral."
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Petersen, have you got a quarter?"
1,1,LISTER,-0.333333,"I've just been shown this great new intelligence test. What you've gotta do is force the coin onto your forehead. And then the more times you can bang yourself on the head, the more intelligent you are."
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"You gonna go for it?"
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Ready? OK. Can you feel it?"
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Can you feel it?"
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Can you feel it?"
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Go!"
1,1,LISTER,1.000000,"Sir, it's Rimmer!"
1,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"I'm turning you in, Rimmer."
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Ooooh!"
1,1,RIMMER,-0.375000,"Right. They're bound to ask the right thigh, which is 10 per cent. They must ask the left thigh, which is 20 per cent. They've *got* to ask one of the forearms. Which means I've passed already! Anything on the left shin's a bonus! Right. CUTIE: Current under tension is ... what's this? Current under tension is equal? Current under tension is expandable? Current under tension is expensive? What does this mean? What does any of it mean? I've covered my body in complete and utter and total absolute nonsense gibberish! Aaaargh! Just relax, relax, relax, relax--"
1,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Er, plus 20 per cent of the ship's course minus the Pythagoras theorem multiplied by two over the X axis minus one equals the total velocity of Red Dwarf, which means I know everything about astro- engineering. Good morning, Lister, for probably the last time."
1,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"You've got it all down, have you, Rimmer?"
1,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Couple of blanks, but I think we're there."
1,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"So you can't remember anything?"
1,1,RIMMER,1.000000,"Think what you will, Lister."
1,1,LISTER,-0.666667,"Rimmer, F-I-S-H, that's how you spell "fish." Then you just keel over. I'm sure it'll all come flooding back to you."
1,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Dry up, Lister."
1,1,HOLLY,0.000000,"Will entrants for the engineer's examination now make their way to the teaching room."
1,1,LISTER,1.000000,"Well, Rimmer, honestly, good luck."
1,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"It's all right, Lister. I'm in *complete* and total control."
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Lock.  *Lock!*"
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Frankenstein! Come on, Frankenstein!"
1,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"Oh, but you're getting really big now, you know? I hope it's not twins. You've already got all me milk ration. Never mind, when the baby cat comes, maybe we can give him water and pretend it's milk. It's only a baby cat, it won't know, eh? Do you want to see my picture of Fiji again, Frankie? You're going to love it there. Look."
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Hi. Where's the Captain's office?"
1,1,LISTER,0.500000,"So that's the Captain's office! So how are you then?"
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Do you know what he wants to see me for?"
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Oh yeah?"
1,1,LISTER,1.000000,"Oh yeah?!"
1,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"You asked to see me, Captain?"
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"What? What cat?"
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"No."
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Er, yes, that one."
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Yes."
1,1,LISTER,-0.333333,"Sir, just suppose I did have a cat. Just suppose. What would you do with Frankenstein?"
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Would you put it back together when you'd finished?"
1,1,LISTER,1.000000,"So, with respect, sir, what's in it for the cat?"
1,1,LISTER,-0.666667,"It's not as easy as that! Me and the cat, we're going to have a baby cat, and we're going to buy a farm on Fiji, and we're going to have a sheep and a cow and three horses, it's me *plan*, and no one can get in the way of it, not even you, and I do respect you! Sir!"
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"No."
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"No!"
1,1,LISTER,1.000000,"It's okay, I can handle it."
1,1,LISTER,1.000000,"RIMMER, are you all right?"
1,1,RIMMER,0.500000,"I can't really remember. I think I did quite well."
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Is this going to hurt?"
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"No."
1,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"Oh. Simple as that, eh?"
1,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"OK, I'm ready."
1,1,HOLLY,0.000000,"OK, Frank."
1,1,HOLLY,0.500000,"Good morning, Dave. It is now safe for you to emerge from stasis."
1,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Haven't I just gone in?"
1,1,HOLLY,0.000000,"Please proceed to the Drive Room for debriefing."
1,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Where is everybody, Hol?"
1,1,HOLLY,-1.000000,"They're dead, Dave."
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Who is?"
1,1,HOLLY,1.000000,"Everybody, Dave."
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"What, Captain Hollister?"
1,1,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Everybody's dead, Dave."
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"What, Todhunter?"
1,1,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Everybody's dead, Dave."
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"What, Selby?"
1,1,HOLLY,-1.000000,"They're all dead. Everybody's dead, Dave."
1,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Petersen isn't, is he?"
1,1,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Everybody is *dead*, Dave."
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Not Chen?"
1,1,HOLLY,0.000000,"Gordon Bennett! Yes! Chen, everybody. Everybody's dead, Dave."
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Rimmer?"
1,1,HOLLY,-0.666667,"He's dead, Dave. Everybody's dead. Everybody is dead, Dave!"
1,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"Wait. Are you trying to tell me everybody's dead?"
1,1,HOLLY,-1.000000,"I wish I'd never let him out in the first place."
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"How?"
1,1,HOLLY,-1.000000,"The drive plate was inefficiently repaired. It blew, and the entire crew was subjected to a lethal dose of cadmium 2 before I could seal the area."
1,1,LISTER,-0.666667,"Oh, this is terrible. And why is it so dirty around here, Hol? What is this stuff?"
1,1,HOLLY,-1.000000,"That is Catering Officer Olaf Petersen."
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Aaaah! I've been eating half the crew! And who's that?"
1,1,HOLLY,0.000000,"That's Captain Hollister."
1,1,LISTER,1.000000,"And that's Todhunter."
1,1,HOLLY,0.000000,"No, that's Second Technician Rimmer."
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Oh, yeah? I didn't recognise him without his report book. What was Rimmer doing in the Drive Room?"
1,1,HOLLY,-1.000000,"He was explaining to the Captain why he hadn't sealed the drive plate properly."
1,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"So wait on. How long was I in stasis?"
1,1,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Well, I couldn't release you until the radiation reached a safe background level."
1,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"How *long*?"
1,1,HOLLY,0.000000,"Three million years."
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Three million years?! I've still got that library book. And what about Krissie? What about Krissie Kochanski?"
1,1,HOLLY,1.000000,"She's dead, Dave."
1,1,LISTER,1.000000,"Oh, hey!"
1,1,HOLLY,-1.000000,"I don't suppose it's any consolation, but if she *were* still alive, the age difference would be insurmountable."
1,1,LISTER,0.200000,"She was part of me plan. I never got round to telling her, but she was going to come with me to Fiji. She was going to wear a white dress and ride the horses and I was going to take care of everything else. It was me plan. I planned it."
1,1,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Well, she won't be much use to you on Fiji now. Not unless it snows and you need something to grit the path with."
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Holly!"
1,1,HOLLY,0.000000,"Sorry. I'm sorry about that. I've been on my own for three million years, and I'm just used to saying what I think. I think I've gone a bit peculiar, to tell you the truth."
1,1,LISTER,-0.333333,"So everyone's dead? I'm on me own? There's just me?"
1,1,HOLLY,1.000000,"Well, technically speaking, yes."
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"What do you mean, "technically speaking?""
1,1,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Hello, Lister. Long time no see."
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Rimmer! You're a hologram?!"
1,1,RIMMER,-0.250000,"Yes. That's because I'm dead. Dead as a can of spam. And it's all thanks to you."
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Me? What did I do?"
1,1,RIMMER,-2.000000,"If you hadn't kept that stupid cat, Lister, and hadn't been sent to stasis, I would have had some help when I was mending the drive plate, and I wouldn't be dead."
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"What's it feel like?"
1,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Death? It's like being on holiday with a group of Germans."
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"No, I mean being a hologram."
1,1,RIMMER,-0.250000,"Do you mind? Being a hologram is fine, Lister. I still have the same drives, the same feelings, the same emotions, but I can't *touch* anything. Never again will I be able to brush a rose against my cheek, cradle a laughing child, or interfere with a woman sexually."
1,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Rimmer, you never used to do any of those things anyway!"
1,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"But I would have done one day, murderer!"
1,1,LISTER,-0.333333,"Hey, hey! I didn't do anything! It was *you* who didn't fix the drive plates properly."
1,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Is this me here?"
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah."
1,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Me?"
1,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Come on, Rimmer, look on the bright side."
1,1,RIMMER,0.250000,"The bright side? *What* bright side? I'm dead, I'm composed entirely of light, and I'm alone in space with a man who'd lose a battle of wits with a stuffed iguana. Where's the bright side?"
1,1,LISTER,-0.750000,"What's an iguana? And look, look, you're not dead, are ya? I mean, you're dead! But you're not *dead* dead, because you're still here, aren't you?"
1,1,RIMMER,-0.600000,"Lister, I'm not really here! I'm not really *me*! Don't you see? I'm a computer simulation of me. That's me, there, that pile of albino mouse droppings."
1,1,LISTER,-0.400000,"Come on. Lot's of people have died. Lots of people have died and then gone on and done really, really well. You're a hologram. So what?"
1,1,RIMMER,0.750000,"I suppose you're right, Lister. I've got to pull myself together. But you've got to help me. You've got to be my hands and my touch."
1,1,LISTER,-0.333333,"I know the sort of things you like to touch. No way, Rimmer. Forget it."
1,1,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Are you smoking, Lister? In the Drive Room?"
1,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"Yeah. I stopped for quite a while, but I'm back on them now."
1,1,RIMMER,-0.333333,"You're on report, squire.  I can't write it down. I'll remember it."
1,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"Ohhh! Rimmer, look, I know it's wrong of me to speak ill of the dead and all that, but you're still a smeghead."
1,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"I beg your pardon?"
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"I said, you're still a smeghead."
1,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Lister, do you have any conception of the penalty for describing a deceased superior technician as a smeghead?"
1,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Lister, will you listen to me? Just listen to me."
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Just shut up. Shut up."
1,1,CAT,0.176471,"Aaahhh, ooowww, eee! How am I looking?  Looking nice. No, wait a minute. I'm looking better than nice. I'm looking dangerous. Aaaoooww, dangerous! Aaaooowww! Hey, what's that? Oh, it's my shadow. Hey, even my shadow's looking nice! I'm looking nice, my shadow's looking nice -- what a team! We are unbelievable! OK, team, this way.  No, this way. Aaaooowww, yeah.  This way!"
1,1,RIMMER,0.500000,"Lister, just hold your horses. Listen to me--"
1,1,CAT,0.333333,"Aaaooowww!  Uh oh. Better make myself look big!"
1,1,CAT,0.200000,"Hee hee! Fearsome. I was fearsome!  Just me and my shadow, ooohhh! Come on boy, walking down the avenue..."
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Aaahhh! Holly, what was that?"
1,1,HOLLY,0.000000,"During the radioactive crisis, Dave, your cat and her kittens were safely sealed in the hold. And they've been breeding there for three million years, and have evolved into the life form you just saw in the corridor."
1,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"I don't get it."
1,1,HOLLY,0.000000,"Well, you know how mankind evolved from apes?"
1,1,LISTER,1.000000,"Yeah, I know that."
1,1,HOLLY,0.750000,"He evolved from cats. His ancestors were cats. He's descended from cats. He is a cat."
1,1,CAT,1.000000,"Aaahhh, ooohhh, yeah--"
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Hello ... Cat?"
1,1,CAT,0.000000,"Whoa! Crease!"
1,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Stand back, Lister."
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Here you go, Cat."
1,1,CAT,0.000000,"Ah, Krispies!"
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Holly says you like these."
1,1,CAT,0.000000,"Mmmm!"
1,1,CAT,-0.666667,"Hey! You monkeys eat off the *floor*? Ain't you got no style or sophistication?"
1,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Oh, I'm sorry, Cat. I'm sorry."
1,1,CAT,-1.000000,"You people are unbelievable."
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Where are all your other catty friends, Cat?"
1,1,CAT,1.000000,"Good Krispies, man!"
1,1,LISTER,-0.250000,"But where are all the other little kitties? Are they gone? Are they dead? Have they left you?"
1,1,RIMMER,0.500000,"Who cares? I want it off the ship!"
1,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"No! He's coming home with us, aren't you, Cat?"
1,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Home? And where exactly is home supposed to be?"
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Earth."
1,1,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Earth? What makes you think there'll be any Earth, Lister? And even if there is, look what it's done to a household pet in three million years."
1,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Can you imagine what humankind has evolved into? To them, you'll be the equivalent of the slime that first crawled out of the oceans."
1,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"I could smarten meself up a bit."
1,1,RIMMER,-0.250000,"Naah. You're a dinosaur. You're extinct. You've got nothing."
1,1,LISTER,0.750000,"Hey, hey! I've still got me plan. And I've still got a cat. OK, it's not Frankenstein, but it's still a cat."
1,1,CAT,0.000000,"Did you say Frankenstein?"
1,1,LISTER,0.500000,"Yeah. She was your great great great great great great grandmother or something."
1,1,CAT,0.000000,"The Holy Mother? The Virgin Birth? No one believes that stuff!"
1,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"The Virgin Birth?!"
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"No, it was a big black tom on Titan."
1,1,CAT,0.000000,"Frankenstein, yeah! I remember that stuff from kitty school. The Holy Mother, saved by Cloister the Stupid, who was frozen in time, and who gaveth of his life that we might live."
1,1,LISTER,-0.666667,"No! No, it's not Cloister, it's me, it's Lister! It's *Lister* the ... stupid?!"
1,1,CAT,0.000000,"Who shall returneth to lead us to Fushal, the Promised Land."
1,1,LISTER,0.000000,"No, it's not Fushal, it's Fiji! And I will! I'll lead you there.  *That's* where we're going. Holly, plot a course for Fiji. Look out, Earth -- the slime's coming home!"
1,2,HOLLY,-1.000000,"This is an SOS distress call from the mining ship Red Dwarf. The crew are dead, killed by a radiation leak. The only survivors were Dave Lister, who was in suspended animation during the disaster, and his pregnant cat, who was safely sealed in the hold. Revived three million years later, Lister's only companions are a life form who evolved from his cat, and Arnold Rimmer, a hologram simulation of one of the dead crew. I am Holly, the ship's computer, with an IQ of 6000. The same IQ as 6000 PE teachers."
1,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"...on an asteroid, excavating for a mine, lived an old plutonium miner and his daughter, Clementine."
1,2,LISTER,1.000000,"Lister, RD-52169."
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"You've got a lisp."
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Can you give me a bacon sandwich with French mustard and black coffee?"
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Your vocabulary unit's not working either."
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Can you just try and give me a black coffee?"
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"That's a bucket."
1,2,RIMMER,-0.200000,"Morning, Lister! How's life in hippie heaven, you pregnant baboon bellied space cookie? What's the plan for the day then? Slobbing in the morning, followed by slobbing in the afternoon, then a bit of a snooze before the main evening's slob? God, you're a disgrace to the species."
1,2,LISTER,1.000000,"Good morning, Rimmer."
1,2,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Clock stop!  6:47, not a bad little time for the mile. Pity I was only doing the 300 metres. Still, I had that conversation with Lister, knock four minutes off for that, and I stopped to have a rest so I wouldn't look too shagged out when I went past him, knock that off, and I've broken the world record! Well done, Rimsey, you're fitter than you thought! Holly, give me a clean uniform."
1,2,HOLLY,0.000000,"9:47 AM, Arnold."
1,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"No, a clean uniform, you idiot."
1,2,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Look, I'm rather busy at the moment."
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Now!"
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Ahhh. And give me a crew cut, Holly. I'm beginning to look like one of those Hell's Angels."
1,2,HOLLY,-0.750000,"Arnold. We're going to hit lightspeed in 24 hours. I have to navigate a ship the size of a city through speeds never before encountered in the human sphere of experience. I'm not a combination of the speaking clock, Moss Bros, and Tweezy Wheezy."
1,2,RIMMER,-0.250000,"Holly, a hologram I may be, but I'm still the highest ranking technician aboard this ship. When I say do something, you do it. Understand? You stupid jumped-up Filofax?"
1,2,HOLLY,0.000000,"I'm a *what*?"
1,2,RIMMER,-0.333333,"You heard. Just get on with it. *Very* short."
1,2,HOLLY,0.000000,"OK, Arnold."
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Have you done it, Hol?"
1,2,HOLLY,0.000000,"Yes."
1,2,RIMMER,-0.500000,"A crewcut? And it's very short?"
1,2,HOLLY,0.000000,"Yes, Arnold."
1,2,RIMMER,-0.666667,"As my father always said, "Shiny clean boots and a spanking short haircut and you can cope with anything." He said that just before that rather unfortunate suicide business. Hmmm."
1,2,LISTER,0.400000,"Ah! Now that one's me with Jim Bexley Speed. He played with the London Jets zero-gravity football team. He was roof attack. As you can see, he was really, really, really, really, really thrilled to meet me."
1,2,CAT,0.000000,"Who's that guy?"
1,2,LISTER,0.250000,"That's me grandmother. She brought me up. She was a great old lady. I got expelled from school once 'cause she nutted the headmaster when I came bottom in French."
1,2,CAT,1.000000,"Wow, that's nice!"
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"That's just the Jupiter rise. Everyone takes that."
1,2,CAT,0.000000,"Who is *that*?"
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"That's me dad. That's the only picture I've got of him."
1,2,CAT,-0.500000,"He's your father? No wonder you're so ugly."
1,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"No, no, that's his dog, Hannah."
1,2,CAT,0.000000,"Dog? What's a dog?"
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"It's just a pet."
1,2,CAT,1.000000,"Ugh, ugleeee."
1,2,LISTER,0.500000,"Listen, you go and get your stuff and let me pack mine, OK? Will you do that for me?"
1,2,CAT,-1.000000,"This, uh, dog. He better not be around here any place, 'cause if he is, I may have to chase him."
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Oh yeah?"
1,2,CAT,0.000000,"Yeah!"
1,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"Do you know how big they are? They're about 18 foot long, and they've got teeth as big as your leg."
1,2,CAT,0.000000,"Yeah?"
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah."
1,2,CAT,-0.500000,"Well, I may have to chase him anyway.  Aagh!"
1,2,LISTER,0.500000,"Oh, Lennon. Look what's happened to McCartney."
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Solid mechanical engineering."
1,2,LISTER,-0.333333,"Hey! Perfection! And they said you was a waste of money."
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"What's he looking at?"
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Who?"
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"That idiotic cat."
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Rimmer, what have you done to your hair?"
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Holly did it."
1,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Why?"
1,2,RIMMER,1.000000,"Because I ordered him to."
1,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"It looks ridiculous."
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"It may look ridiculous to you, Lister, but I like it like this. It makes me feel like a man."
1,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Yeah, and you'll probably get one, looking like that."
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"There's nothing wrong with short hair, Lister. It gives a man a sense of dignity, a sense of discipline."
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Rimmer, have you seen it?"
1,2,RIMMER,-0.666667,"I don't need to see it. I didn't get this haircut to look good. This is a haircut designed for action, not poncing around in. It may be a bit severe, a bit too green beret, but you are how you look, and I look like a complete and total tit! Holly! Holly!"
1,2,HOLLY,-0.250000,"This is a recording. I'm afraid Holly is busy at the moment. If you'd like to leave a message after the bleep, he'll get back to you. Bleep."
1,2,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Holly, this is Rimmer. Remember me? Rimmer. Arnold Rimmer. The poor goit you made look like Helen Shapiro. I'll see you toast on the fires of hell for this."
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Shut up.  What are you doing?"
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"I'm going into stasis. I though Holly told you."
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Stasis? What for?"
1,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well, Holly said to go into it while we went through lightspeed, and then I thought, what the hell? Why not stay in till we get back to Earth?"
1,2,RIMMER,0.166667,"Earth? But that's three million years away! You can't leave me alone for three million years, I'll go peculiar.  Holly, look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be rude. Can I please have my own hair back?  Pretty please with sugar on?"
1,2,HOLLY,0.000000,"I'll think about it, Arnold."
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Holly's supposed to have told you. I thought you didn't mind."
1,2,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Mind? Mind? Why should I mind? Three hundred thousand millennia alone while you're in suspended animation. I'll be fine. I'll do that crossword book, that should kill a couple of centuries."
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Holly'll switch you off until we come back out."
1,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Even better. Switch me on, switch me off, like I'm some battery powered sex aid."
1,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Oh, come on, Rimmer, don't give me this."
1,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Don't give you what? I'm dead, Lister, or hadn't you noticed?"
1,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"I know you're dead, Rimmer. Don't whinge on about it!"
1,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Sorry to be a bore."
1,2,LISTER,-0.333333,"I mean, you're everything you were when you were alive. Same personality. Same everything."
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Apart from the minuscule detail that I'm a stiffie."
1,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Look, Rimmer, death isn't the handicap it used to be in the olden days. It doesn't screw your career up like it used to."
1,2,RIMMER,-0.500000,"That's what they say, Lister. But if you had two people coming for a job, and one of them was dead, which one would you pick?"
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"It depends which is better qualified."
1,2,RIMMER,0.500000,"Bull pats! When was the last time you saw a dead newsreader?"
1,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Channel 27 have a hologram reading the news."
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Oh, groovy, funky Channel 27. Big smegging deal. You livvies hate us deadies."
1,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Rimmer, if I'm gonna go back to Earth I'm gonna have to go into stasis. It's gonna take 4000 years just to turn around. You can't do a three point turn when you're this close to lightspeed, you know."
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Oh really? And where did you read that, the Ladybird Book of Astro-Navigation?"
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"It happens to be true."
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"I know it's true, modo. I have taken the astro-navigation exam -- nine times. Ten, if you count the time I had my spasm."
1,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Rimmer, you'll only be turned off until we get back to Earth."
1,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Where you won't need me, so I won't get switched back on."
1,2,LISTER,0.500000,"They might be able to cure you. They've probably made great advances and that while we've been away."
1,2,RIMMER,-0.250000,"Oh, yes, I expect they cured death the instant we left Earth. I expect doctors' surgeries are packed with the dead. "Hello, Mrs Johnson, take one of these three times a day, you'll soon be living again. Carol, next corpse please.""
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Well, they might!"
1,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Yes, Lister, they might, if the Earth hasn't blown up."
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Or the ants haven't taken over."
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Well, you'll be in your element if insects are in control. You'll probably get a decent job at last."
1,2,LISTER,1.000000,"Yeah, yeah."
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"You'll probably run for government."
1,2,LISTER,1.000000,"Yeah, yeah."
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"You'll probably even make it as a male model."
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Git."
1,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"To Ganymede and Titan, yes sir, I've been around, but there ain't no place in the whole of space like that good old toddlin' town."
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Oh, Lunar Ci--"
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Lunar City Seven--"
1,2,LISTER,1.000000,"And you can, can you?"
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Well, go on then."
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Lunar City Seven..."
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"What was that?!"
1,2,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Erm, er, 11:14 ship time, Dave."
1,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"No, Holly, what was that flash?"
1,2,HOLLY,-1.000000,"We've broken the light barrier 22 hours early."
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Oh. Is everyone all right?"
1,2,HOLLY,-0.750000,"I can't do it. I can't cope. We're going at the speed of light. Me bottle's gone."
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Holly! Is everyone all right?"
1,2,HOLLY,-0.200000,"No! I'm not! I thought I could navigate at lightspeed, but I just can't wrap me head round it.  Gordon Bennett! That was a close one!"
1,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"Holly, what's the problem? You're supposed to have an IQ of 6000, aren't you?"
1,2,HOLLY,0.666667,"Look, we're travelling faster than the speed of light. That means, by the time we see something, we've already passed through it. Even with an IQ of 6000, it's still brown trousers time."
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Can I help?"
1,2,HOLLY,0.000000,"No, it's all right. I'm getting the hang of it now. Left a bit, straighten her up. I better go."
1,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"To Ganymede and Titan, yes sir, I've been around--"
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Rimmer! Rimmer!"
1,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"To Ganymede and Titan, yes sir, I've been a-- *Rimmer*!"
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"What? What is it?"
1,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Did you see anything really weird in that mirror?"
1,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Yes, you, you ugly goit."
1,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"No, it was ... really odd."
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"What was?"
1,2,LISTER,-0.333333,"Oh, nothing. Forget it. Doesn't matter."
1,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"*What* doesn't matter?"
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Nothing! Forget it! It doesn't matter!"
1,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Lister, have you been at that marijuana gin again?"
1,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"I said forget it, it doesn't matter."
1,2,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Fine! Well, if you have any more problems with *nothing* and things that don't matter, just scream out my name hysterically and I'll come pelting down the corridor. Allright?"
1,2,CAT,-0.200000,"This little kitty went into stasis. Oooo! This little kitty stayed home. Ooh! Yeah, my clothes look good."
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"What are you doing?"
1,2,CAT,0.000000,"I'm doing what you said do."
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"I said, "Take a few essential basics you couldn't bear to leave behind.""
1,2,CAT,0.500000,"Right! These are all I'm taking. Just these, and the other ten racks. Travel light, move fast!"
1,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"You can't take all of this. There's no room."
1,2,CAT,-0.500000,"OK, then I'll leave ... this!  I'll just have to do without it."
1,2,LISTER,1.000000,"You can take two suits and that's it."
1,2,CAT,0.000000,"Two suits? Then I'm staying!"
1,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"You can't stay. By the time I come out, you'll be dead."
1,2,CAT,-1.000000,"Two suits *is* dead!"
1,2,CAT,-0.500000,"Hey! If I cut off my leg and leave it behind, can I take three?"
1,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"We're going into stasis in ten minutes. I'll meet you in the sleeping quarters."
1,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Yo, Rimmer, look, I've been thinking--"
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"What?"
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"You know, about going into stasis and everything."
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"How did I do what?"
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"What do you mean, "How did I do what?""
1,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Lister, don't be a gimboid."
1,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"I'm not being a gimboid!"
1,2,RIMMER,-0.500000,"I've just been in the library, thinking. And I've decided--"
1,2,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Shut up! As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted, I've decided, when you go into stasis, I want to stay behind. I want to be left on."
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"What, on your own for the rest of your life?"
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"What things?"
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Eh?"
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"I said *what*?"
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"What's going on?"
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"*You're* space crazy!"
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"*I'm* space crazy?! You're the one who's space crazy!"
1,2,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Well, it probably is deja vu. It sounds like it."
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Aaahhh! Rimmer!  I've just seen you walk out of that door."
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"What?"
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"How did you do that?"
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"How did I do what?"
1,2,LISTER,-2.000000,"You just this second walked out of that door."
1,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Lister, don't be a gimboid."
1,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"I swear, on me grandmother's life, as you walked out of *that* door, you came in *this* one!"
1,2,RIMMER,-0.500000,"I've just been in the library, thinking. And I've decided--"
1,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Rimmer, I'm telling ya--"
1,2,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Shut up! As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted, I've decided, when you go into stasis, I want to stay behind. I want to be left on."
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Rimmer, you've just come in and said exactly these things."
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"What things?"
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"You said that!"
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"I said *what*?"
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"And that! You said that!"
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"You are space crazy!"
1,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"And then you said, "Well it probably is deja vu.""
1,2,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Well, it probably is deja vu. It sounds like it."
1,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"Well, go on then. Shake your head and walk out."
1,2,LISTER,0.500000,"Rimmer, listen! Will you just listen?"
1,2,CAT,-0.333333,"My tooth! My tooth! I think I lost my tooth!"
1,2,LISTER,0.500000,"Cat, wait! Rimmer, listen!"
1,2,CAT,-1.500000,"I'm going to eat you little fishies, I'm going to eat-- Ah, oh, ah, ah, I was just making sure your fish were OK. I wasn't going to eat them!"
1,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"He just walked past us."
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"It must be something to do with lightspeed."
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Holly, what's going on?"
1,2,LISTER,1.000000,"It's lightspeed, I bet you."
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Is your name Holly?"

1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Holly?"
1,2,HOLLY,0.000000,"Mmm?"
1,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"*What* is going on?"
1,2,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Look, I'm a tenth-generation AI hologrammic computer. I'm not your mum."
1,2,RIMMER,1.000000,"Yes, fantastic."
1,2,HOLLY,0.333333,"What do you want this time? A hand with your homework? Or would you like me to sew little name tags in your PE kit?"
1,2,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Holly, watch my lips. What ... is ... hap ... pening?"
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"With the mirror and the Cat and everything."
1,2,HOLLY,-0.666667,"Oh, that. You're seeing future echoes. Didn't I explain this to you?"
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"What are future echoes?"
1,2,HOLLY,0.000000,"How simple do you want this?"
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Ah, so Lister can understand it."
1,2,HOLLY,1.000000,"Oh dear."
1,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"It's difficult, I know."
1,2,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Well, we're travelling faster than LS, right?"
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"What's LS?"
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Smartarse."
1,2,HOLLY,1.000000,"Consequently, you're catching up with things you're about to do before you've actually done them."
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Ah. So we're seeing bits of the future?"
1,2,HOLLY,0.000000,"Yes."
1,2,LISTER,0.500000,"See, I told you it was lightspeed. You should have asked me."
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Can they see us?"
1,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"So, wait, are you saying that the Cat is going to break his tooth sometime in the future?"
1,2,HOLLY,-0.500000,"Yes. I didn't think you wanted it this simple."
1,2,CAT,-1.000000,"Hey, ain't nobody gonna break *my* tooth!"
1,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"How long is this going to last?"
1,2,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Until the reverse thrust takes effect and we drop below lightspeed."
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"What's that photograph?"
1,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"That's me and Frankenstein, isn't it?"
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"No, the one with the babies."
1,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"Babies! I've never seen it before."
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Ah. Holly, is this what you call a future echo?"
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Two babies! How do I get two babies?"
1,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"To Ganymede and Titan, yes sir, I've been around, but there ain't no place in the whole of space--"
1,2,LISTER,-0.400000,"What's this, guys?  "Don't go into stasis. Please don't leave us with Rimmer." I'm sorry, guys, I've got to. We need you."
1,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"I mean, there's nothing for me here. I want to go back to Earth! Oh, don't do that. I mean, I don't care what it's like, it's got to be better than this. I don't care if the dolphins have taken over and all the people are in the human-being-itarium, you know? I just want to find out!"
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"What was *that*?!"
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"What was that?"
1,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Brace yourself for a bit of a shock, Lister, but I just saw you die."
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"What?!"
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"I did warn you to brace yourself."
1,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"You didn't give me much of a chance."
1,2,RIMMER,1.000000,"I gave you ample bracing time!"
1,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"No you didn't. You didn't even pause."
1,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Well, I'm sorry! *I've* just had a rather nasty experience. *I* have just seen someone I know die in the most hideous, hideous way!"
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah! *Me*!"
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"You were fiddling around with the navi--"
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"I don't want to know! I don't want to know!"
1,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"You don't want to know how you die?"
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"No! Was it quick?"
1,2,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Well, I wouldn't say it was super fast. Not if you count the thrashing around and the agonised squealing."
1,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"You're really loving this, aren't you?"
1,2,RIMMER,-2.000000,"What a horrible thing to say!"
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"It was definitely me?"
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Oh yes."
1,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"I don't want to know.  How old did I look?"
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"How old are you now?"
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Twenty-five. How old did I look."
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Mmmm ... mid twenties."
1,2,LISTER,-0.333333,"*Smeg*! I'm not ready! I'm not smegging ready!"
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"You did seem surprised."
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Ah! Did you actually see me face?"
1,2,RIMMER,1.000000,"You were wearing a hat, but it was definitely you."
1,2,LISTER,-0.333333,"Well there you go, I won't wear the hat. Then it can't happen, can it? I can live without a hat."
1,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Lister, it *has* happened. You can't change it, any more than you can change what you had for breakfast yesterday."
1,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"Hey, it hasn't happened, has it? It has "will have going to have happened" happened, but it hasn't actually "happened" happened yet, actually."
1,2,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Poppycock! It will be happened; it shall be going to be happening; it will be was an event that could will have been taken place in the future. Simple as that. Your bucket's been kicked, baby."
1,2,LISTER,1.000000,"Sez you."
1,2,RIMMER,0.333333,"Sez me and Albert Einstein, thank you very much. Albo and I happen to agree on this one. It's called the Theory of Relativity."
1,2,LISTER,0.250000,"All right, OK, OK. Right. The Cat broke his tooth in a future echo, right? Now if I can stop him breaking it..."
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Can't be done."
1,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"...then I can stop me from dying!"
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Can't be done."
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Now, how would the Cat break his tooth?"
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"He'd be eating something. Eating something hard.  My robot goldfish! Eating my robot goldfish! Holly, where's the Cat?"
1,2,HOLLY,-1.000000,"He's just going into your sleeping quarters, Dave."
1,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Oh, smegging hell!"
1,2,CAT,0.500000,"Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm back! Feeling good! How am I looking?"
1,2,CAT,-0.125000,"Good! You know, I wish I was someone else. Then I could kiss me. I think I'll investigate... ...these! Mm-mm, I just ate. But ... one little fishy? Yeah, yeah! I'm gonna eat you little fishy!"
1,2,CAT,0.000000,"I'm gonna eat you little fishy! Yeah, yeah!"
1,2,CAT,0.333333,"Yeah! I got you! I'm gonna--"
1,2,LISTER,-0.333333,"I got the fish! I'm not gonna die! I'm not gonna die!"
1,2,CAT,0.200000,"Hey, you crazy monkey! You creased my suit!  My tooth. My tooth, my tooth! I think I lost my tooth!"
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Lister! Allow me to be the first to offer my commiserations."
1,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"You're really, really loving this, aren't you?"
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Come on!  "Death isn't the handicap it used to be in the olden days. It doesn't screw your career up the way it used to.""
1,2,LISTER,0.500000,"You're right. There's always some good in every situation."
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Absolutely, Lister! And in this case, you're about to do the largest splits you'll ever do in your life."
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"I get blown up then?"
1,2,RIMMER,1.000000,"*Bits* of you do."
1,2,LISTER,-0.166667,"It's not fair. There's loads of things I've never done. Like ... I've never had a prawn vindaloo. And I've never read ... a book. And I wanted to have a family. And I wanted to have loads of practice in the things that you've got to do to get a family."
1,2,RIMMER,-0.400000,"Holly, I'd like to send an internal memo. Black border. Begins, "To Dave Lister, Condolences on your passing away." What's that poem? "Now, weary traveller, rest your head, for just like me, you're utterly dead.""
1,2,HOLLY,-0.333333,"Emergency. Emergency. There's an emergency going on."
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"What is it, Hol?"
1,2,HOLLY,1.000000,"There's an emergency, Dave. The navicomp's overheating, and I need your help in the drive room."
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Ooh!"
1,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"Come in number 169, your time is up. OK, what was I wearing?"
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Ahhh ... that jacket, and that red T-shirt."
1,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"You said yourself, I can't stop it. Let's get it over with."
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Ah, Lister, what's that for?"
1,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"I'm going out like I came in -- screaming and kicking."
1,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"You can't whack death on the head!"
1,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"If he comes near me I'm gonna rip his nipples off!"
1,2,HOLLY,-1.000000,"I'm afraid it can't cope with the influx of data at lightspeed, Dave, could you hook it up to the drive computer for me?"
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Six ... five..."
1,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"...Four ... three ... two ... aaaaaahhhhhh! One!"
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"I did it! I'm not gonna die! *Aaargh!*"
1,2,CAT,0.000000,"Aaargh! Dog attack!"
1,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I don't know why you're so chirpy."
1,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"I'm not gonna die! I'm not gonna die!"
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"But for how long? It'll probably happen tomorrow or Thursday."
1,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Maybe it's not going to happen at all!"
1,2,RIMMER,0.666667,"It was you! I saw you. I'm sure it was you."
1,2,RIMMER,1.000000,"Thank heavens you've still got all your marbles, Lister."
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Shhh!"
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Who's Bexley?"
1,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"I was always going to call my second son Bexley, after Jim Bexley Speed."
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Your second son? What were you going to call your first son?"
1,2,LISTER,0.500000,"Jim. After Jim Bexley Speed."
1,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Rimmer, you saw me son die!"
1,2,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Never mind this tot, what about *me*, old man? What happens to *me*? Do I become an officer?"
1,2,LISTER,1.000000,"Rimmer, I'm going to have two sons! Isn't it fantastic?"
1,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"But one of them dies."
1,2,LISTER,1.000000,"Yeah, well, everyone dies. You're born, and you die. The bit in the middle's called life, and that's still to come!"
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"What about me? What happens to me?"
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"He can't hear us, Rimmer. He's from the future."
1,2,RIMMER,1.000000,"Ah, but if I ask you now, you can remember it, and when you get to be him, you can tell me."
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Boss thinking."
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Yes!"
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Yes!"
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Yes!"
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Yes!"
1,2,RIMMER,-0.500000,"You goit!  No, *you* goit!"
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"You're all goits! I'm surrounded by goits! Holly, you're a goit!"
1,2,HOLLY,0.000000,"I'm a what?"
1,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"You heard!"
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"What's happening, Hol? Are we going to see my funeral or something?"
1,2,HOLLY,-0.666667,"Look, the faster we go, the more into the future the future echoes are. And now, since we've just started to slow down, the future echoes are nearer to the present. Clear?"
1,2,LISTER,0.000000,"No."
1,2,HOLLY,0.000000,"Tough."
1,2,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Wait a minute. I don't understand how you're supposed to get two sons without a woman on this ship."
1,2,LISTER,0.500000,"Neither do I. But it's going to be a laugh finding out."
1,3,HOLLY,-1.000000,"This is an SOS distress call from the mining ship Red Dwarf. The crew are dead, killed by a radiation leak. The only survivors were Dave Lister, who was in suspended animation during the disaster, and his pregnant cat, who was safely sealed in the hold. Revived three million years later, Lister's only companions are a life form who evolved from his cat, and Arnold Rimmer, a hologram simulation of one of the dead crew. In the 3 million years we've been away, it is my fond hope that mankind has abolished war, cured all disease, and gotten rid of those little western saloon doors you get in trendy clothes shops."

1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"4,691 irradiated haggis."
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Rimmer, it's Saturday night! I want to boogie on down!"
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"4,691 irradiated haggis."

1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"4,691 irradiated hag-g-gis."
1,3,LISTER,1.000000,"Rimmer, will you stop saying 4,981 irradiated haggis and speak to me!"
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"4,691 irradiated haggis."
1,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Rimmer, I want to go for a *drink*!"
1,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"4,691 irradiated haggis!"
1,3,LISTER,1.000000,"I want to have some fun!"
1,3,RIMMER,0.500000,"This *is* fun! Are you mad?"
1,3,LISTER,0.333333,"You read something out. I say check. Where's the fun?"
1,3,RIMMER,-0.250000,"All right. We'll put you in command for a few seconds, Capitaine.  What's the plan, sir? Come on, lickety split."
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Go back to Earth."
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"And in the meantime?"
1,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"I don't know, generally slob around, have a few laughs."
1,3,RIMMER,-0.400000,"Excellent plan, Lister! *Excellent* plan! Brilliant plan! There was me thinking you hadn't thought about it, when clearly you have. Right, I'll just stand over here and laugh slobbily, shall I?"
1,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Rimmer, I'm going for a drink. Gimme me cigarettes."
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"I only owe you four and three quarters."
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"You owe me five!"
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"It's one cigarette for each day you obey me."
1,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"Well, there you go. Five days, five cigarettes."
1,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Ah, but I'm penalising you a quarter of a cigarette for saying "check" in a variety of silly voices while doing the homogenised puddings."
1,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well, I'm taking five."
1,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"You take five, Lister, I'll eject the rest of the ship's stock into space."
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Ha-ha-ha-ha! So they're somewhere near an airlock?"
1,3,RIMMER,-0.250000,"Ha-ha-ha-ha. You'll never find them, Lister. I was always a master at hide and seek as a child. It's not a gift you lose."
1,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"OK, quark brain."
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Even it out. Take out the flaky bits."
1,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Oh, I really, really hate you, Rimmer."
1,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"Have a lovely, lovely time, Lister. Give my regards to the air."
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Lights."
1,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"Holly, why Rimmer's hologram? Why did you have to bring Rimmer's hologram back? He was the most unpopular man on board this ship. I mean, he even had to organise his own surprise birthday parties."
1,3,HOLLY,0.000000,"And who should I have brought back, then?"
1,3,LISTER,-0.200000,"Anyone. Chen. Petersen. I mean, Hermann Gerring would have been more of a laugh than Rimmer. I mean, OK, he was a drug-crazed transvestite, but at least we could have gone dancing!"
1,3,HOLLY,1.000000,"I brought Rimmer back because he's the best person to keep you sane."
1,3,LISTER,-2.000000,"Oh, crap!"
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Not you!"
1,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"What about Kristine Kochanski? You could have brought Kristine back."
1,3,HOLLY,-1.000000,"In your entire life, your shared conversations with her totalled 173 words."
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"So?"
1,3,HOLLY,1.000000,"In terms of wordage, you actually had a better relationship with your rubber plant."
1,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"I know, but *Rimmer*?!"
1,3,HOLLY,0.500000,"He's the person you knew best. Over 14 million words in all."
1,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Holly, 7 million of those were me telling him to smeg off, and the other 7 million were him putting me on report for telling him to smeg off."
1,3,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Jean Paul Sartre said hell was being locked forever in a room with your friends."
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Holly, all his mates were French."

1,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"My uncle's brain's in a jar. It's really sad."
1,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"He's not dead yet."
1,3,RIMMER,0.363636,"Excuse me, please. Could you please excuse me? Some of us have more important things to do than wiggle our posteriors. Could you move please? Please? Thank you. Could you move? Excuse me, please. Excuse me. Excuse me, please. Excuse me!"
1,3,RIMMER,0.500000,"If you want to dance, do it over there.  Sorry."
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Who is?"
1,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"I've got no big thing about Kochanski."
1,3,LISTER,1.000000,"Shut up!"
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Selby, have you ever eaten a coconut whole?"
1,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Listen, hadron head, I've got no big thing about Kristine Kochanski!"
1,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Ha ha ha. Lister, where's my revision timetable?"
1,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Come on, no one works Saturday night!"
1,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"You don't work *any* night. You don't work any *day*!"
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Skive hard, play hard! That's our motto!"
1,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Look, I've got my engineering re-sit on Monday. I don't know anything. Where's my revision timetable?"
1,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Wait, is this the thing in all different colours, with all the subjects divided into study periods and rest periods and self testing time?"
1,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"It took me seven weeks to make it. I've got to cram my whole revision into one night."
1,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"Hang on, is this the thing with the note on it in red which said, "Vital. Valuable. Urgent. Do not touch on pain of death?""
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Yes!"
1,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"I threw it away."
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Ha ha ha ha. Tee hee. Where is it?"
1,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"No, I didn't. I pinned it up on the wall."
1,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"What? Why?"
1,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"To dry it out."
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"What do you mean, dry it out?"
1,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well, I spilled a cold vindaloo on it. Don't worry, it's a little bit red, but you can read most of it, especially if you scrape the lumps off."
1,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"You spoiled my -- no, I haven't got time. I'm taking learning drugs and all I'm memorising is this conversation."
1,3,RIMMER,-0.300000,"Where's my revision timetable, Lister? It's Saturday night. No one works Saturday night. You don't work any night. You don't work any day. Skive hard, play hard, that's our motto. Lister, where did you put my revision timetable. It's Saturday night. No one works Saturday night. You don't work..."
1,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"OK, leave it alone, leave it..."
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"...alone."
1,3,CAT,0.384615,"Aaaoooww! Ooh, babe! Hey Yeah! Jump back! Come back! Hep! How'm I looking?  I'm looking nice. My hair is nice. My face is nice. My suit is nice. I'm looking really nice! Aaaooowww! Jump back! Hoo! Ack! Hey! I wonder how I'm looking now?  Still looking nice. My hair's still nice. My face is still nice. My suit -- I'm just nice, period. Aaaoooww! Jump back! Get down! Hoo!"
1,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Good evening, you stupid, stinking, festering, gimboid of a cat."
1,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Er, you're going to put these cigarettes back, aren't you?"
1,3,CAT,0.500000,"Are you crazy? This is my all time best lucky find I ever found in the whole of today."
1,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"No no no no no. You are going to put these cigarettes back *quickly* before he comes."
1,3,CAT,0.000000,"These are mine!"
1,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"They're not yours -- put them back."
1,3,CAT,0.500000,"See this hand? It is mine. See these things? They are mine."
1,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"I'll give you a fish."
1,3,CAT,0.000000,"One fish? Ha!"
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Two fish."
1,3,CAT,0.000000,"For all these shiny things?"
1,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"I'll show you how to get all the fish you'll ever need."
1,3,CAT,-1.000000,"Five fish?"
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Mmm."
1,3,CAT,0.000000,"Five fish? I'll be rich!"
1,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"You certainly will! Yes, come on!"
1,3,CAT,1.000000,"All right!"
1,3,CAT,-1.000000,"Five fish?"
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Six fish!"
1,3,CAT,0.000000,"Oooowwww!"
1,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Lister, what on Titan is this din? *Lister*!!"
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"What on Titan is this din?"
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"It's Rastabilly-Ska."
1,3,RIMMER,-0.666667,"Is this it? It's got a health warning on it, you know. It's bad for you."
1,3,LISTER,1.000000,"It's a classic."
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,""Danger. Government Health Warning. This music can make you irritable and irrational and has been linked to disorders of the nervous system and bowels.""
1,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Rimmer, no one takes any notice of that stuff."
1,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Lister, if you want to dice with death, fine, but don't poison my sound waves. Off!"
1,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Why don't you listen to something really classical, like Mozart, Mendelssohn, or Motorhead?"
1,3,RIMMER,-0.666667,"I think I've gone video-blind. Is that painting yours? It's rubbish!"
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"It's a mirror."
1,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I need some sleep."
1,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Rimmer, do you, ah, do you remember Kristine Kochanski?"
1,3,RIMMER,0.200000,"Navigation officer? Yes, I remember her. Snooty cow. She used to look down on me. She used to call me "Rimmer.""
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Everybody called you "Rimmer.""
1,3,RIMMER,-0.400000,"Well, it's the way she said it, though. Rimmer. Rimmer. To rhyme with "scum." God, she had a chip on her shoulder, Lister."
1,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"Oh yeah? Well, I want to go on a date with her."
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Tough. She's dead."
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"For just one night!"
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Nope."
1,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"I want to turn you off."
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Nope."
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"For just four hours."
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Nope."
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"And spend an evening with her hologram."
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Nope."
1,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Look, I know you're worried I won't turn you back on..."
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Nope."
1,3,LISTER,1.000000,"But I promise, I swear, if you tell me where you've hidden the hologram disks..."
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Nope."
1,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Oh, you're not even prepared to discuss it."
1,3,RIMMER,-0.333333,"We are discussing it, Lister. What's this, if it's not a discussion? A diesel locomotive?"
1,3,LISTER,1.000000,"Rimmer, I promise, I *swear* I'll turn you back on!"
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Is that it, Lister? Is that the entire proposal?"
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Yes."
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Well, Lister..."
1,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"No, think about it seriously, don't just dismiss it."
1,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"All right, all right, I'll think about it."
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"You're just going to say no!"
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Don't interrupt! I'm thinking about it."
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"But you're just going to say no!"
1,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Not necessarily. I'm mulling it over."
1,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Yyyyyyeeeeee ... no."
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Look, what is it, man? Don't you trust me?"
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Black card, Lister. I'm holding up a black card. Conversation over."
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"I've always been crazy about her. I never did anything about it."
1,3,RIMMER,-0.250000,"Oh, Lister, you've forgotten the colour code. White. The white card is to continue the discussion, but this is a black card situation. Discussion over."
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Listen,..."
1,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Da da da, black card, black card, black card, da da da, black card..."
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"I was talking about something else!"
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"White card. Go on."
1,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Right, for a start, I want to stop all this black card and white card smeg, it's driving me crazy."
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Black card!"
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Oh, for four hours! Just, I want to spend an *evening* with her hologram! What's so wrong with that?"
1,3,RIMMER,0.500000,"You don't know when to stop, do you, Lister? I'm your superior!"
1,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"Technician was the lowest rank on this ship. The man who changed the bog rolls was higher than us!"
1,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Yes, well he's not here now, Lister, and we are, and there's still a pecking order, and I'm pecking you, baby!"
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"OK, Rimmer. OK."
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"OK?"
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"OK."
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Is that a threat, Lister?"
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah."
1,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Actually, "OK," Lister, is not a threat, technically speaking."
1,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"It is when you mean it to mean what I mean it to mean, and I mean it to mean, OK, Rimmer, O-K!"
1,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"No, Lister, "OK" is never a threat, no matter how many A's you put on the end."
1,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"I'm going to pass the exams and become an officer."
1,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"Oh, come on, wise up, Lister!"
1,3,LISTER,0.500000,"You'll have to salute me, Rimmer! You'll have to call me "sir!" You'll have to give me Kochanski! And me cigarettes!"
1,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"And on that day, Lister, Satan will be skating to work."
1,3,RIMMER,0.428571,"Lister! Rise and shine, el slobbo! Come on, I've been awake for hours, Lister! Up, up, up! Come on! Exercise, Lister! Exercise, sonny boy!"
1,3,RIMMER,-0.375000,"Quarter to two? I didn't set my motivator! I was supposed to be up at seven! Why didn't he wake me? He knows I'm a heavy sleeper. Have I got to remind him to do everything for me? He's so irresponsible. Holly, give me a cold shower, will you, please?"
1,3,HOLLY,0.000000,"Certainly, Arnold."
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Not that cold! Hotter! Hotter! *Aaahhh!*"
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Not that hot! Just forget it. Can you give me a clean uniform? Perhaps you can manage that?"
1,3,RIMMER,0.500000,"Thank you, Holly. Where's Lister?"
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Er, Holly, where's my arm? This isn't my arm. Whose arm is this?"
1,3,HOLLY,-0.500000,"I'm sorry, Arnold.  Your physical data disk has become corrupted."
1,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Don't give me excuses, give me my arm back."
1,3,HOLLY,1.000000,"I'll have to refresh the graphics from a backup."
1,3,RIMMER,0.250000,"It's got tattoos. "Candy," "Denmark forever." Is this Petersen's arm, Holly? I've got the arm of a Danish moron."
1,3,HOLLY,0.000000,"If you'll just bear with me for a few minutes, Arn."
1,3,RIMMER,-0.375000,"It's not good enough, Holly. It's traumatic enough being *dead*. And whose ears are these, Holly? They're like two giant radar dishes stuck higgledy-piggledy to the side of my head. I mean, just look at them! Look at them! Whose were these ears, Holly? An African elephant's?"
1,3,HOLLY,0.000000,"They're your ears, Arnold."
1,3,RIMMER,-0.666667,"Er, it must have been the way I slept. I haven't got time for this. Where's Lister?"
1,3,HOLLY,0.000000,"That information is security protected."
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"What's he doing?"
1,3,CAT,0.000000,"Mmm-mmm!"
1,3,CAT,0.000000,"Fish!"
1,3,CAT,0.000000,"Fish!"
1,3,CAT,0.000000,"Fish!"
1,3,CAT,0.000000,"Fish!"
1,3,CAT,0.000000,"Fish!"
1,3,CAT,0.000000,"Fish!"
1,3,CAT,1.000000,"I will!"
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Lister? Where's Lister?"
1,3,CAT,0.000000,"They're all mine! The fish is mine!"
1,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"I don't want your fish, you stupid cat. Where's Lister?"
1,3,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Idiot. Holly? As senior rank aboard this ship, I order you to tell me where he is."
1,3,HOLLY,0.000000,"I've told you. I can't."
1,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Holly, that's an order! You stupid ugly goit."
1,3,HOLLY,-0.500000,"Ugly? I'll have you know I chose this face out of the billions available because it happened to be the face of the greatest and most prolific lover who ever lived."
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Really? Well he must have operated in the dark a lot."
1,3,HOLLY,0.000000,"You what?"
1,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"And when are you going to give me my own arm back? I refuse to walk around all day with Petersen's arm. You know what he was like. God only knows where this arm's been."
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Ahh! What's he doing?"
1,3,HOLLY,-0.500000,"Beats me, Arnie. Seems to have a mind of its own."
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Tell him to stop it!"
1,3,CAT,0.000000,"What is this? Cabaret? Entertainment while you eat?"
1,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"No, no, no!"
1,3,CAT,0.500000,"Hey, can you place bets? My bet is on *this* arm!"
1,3,RIMMER,0.500000,"*Aagh!*"
1,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"Holly, you're absolutely gorgeous and handsome and delicious, *please* tell him to stop it."
1,3,HOLLY,0.000000,"All right. Just give me a couple of seconds."
1,3,RIMMER,0.250000,"Ah, look at that. I've outwitted him. He's given up. Look, he's given up."
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"OOOOOO!!!"
1,3,HOLLY,0.000000,"There. Done it. Just in time."
1,3,CAT,0.000000,"Hey! That was good! You should have finished on a song, it would have been perfect."
1,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I hate everything."
1,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Oohh. Where is Lister, the little worm?"
1,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Lister? Listy, Listy, Wisty, Lister? I know you're here, Lister. You're always here Sunday afternoons.  What are you two doing here?! Skutters don't have time off!"
1,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"You really must think I'm stupid. I'll deal with you two later."
1,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"You're serious about this, Lister, aren't you?"
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Go away. I'm busy."
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Off!"
1,3,RIMMER,-0.428571,"You seriously believe a piece of fungus like you has got the stuff to become an officer? You've got the brains of diarrhea and the breeding of a maggot. I mean, what are you writing on, Lister? The inside of a chocolate wrapper?! I mean, come on, where's your loose leaf files? Where's your pencil? Where's your protractor and your hole reinforcers?"
1,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Rimmer, I'm going to pass this exam by *knowing* things."
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"OK, what's a porous circuit?"
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Don't know."
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"How do you calculate acceleration?"
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Don't know."
1,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Oh, this is sad! What's Boyle's Fourth Law?"
1,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Don't eat greasy food?"
1,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"These are basic engineering precepts, Lister! How do you expect to pass the engineering exam?"
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"I don't. I expect to pass the chef's exam."
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Chef? You want to become a chef?"
1,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"Not really. I just want to become your superior."
1,3,RIMMER,-0.333333,"But a chef? A white hatted ponce? That's not a real officer!"
1,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"It outranks *you*, smeg-for-brains!"
1,3,RIMMER,-0.250000,"And Lister, what's this? Learning drugs? They're illegal, matey! I'm afraid you're in very serious, grave, deep trouble, Lister. Where did you get them? I want names. I want places. I want dates."
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Arnold Rimmer. His locker. This morning."
1,3,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Why am I worried? You'll never stick at it. You'll never pass."
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Say, "You'll never pass, Mr. Lister, sir!" Practice, Rimmer, makes perfect."
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Question four. Underline that. "What does the red spectrum tell us about quasars?""
1,3,CAT,-0.666667,"Oooooohhhhhh! I'm going to die! I've been fished to death!"
1,3,RIMMER,-0.666667,"My answer: In answering the question, "What does the red spectrum tell us about quasars?" -- write bigger -- there are various words that need to be defined. What is a spectrum, what is a red one, why is it red, and why is it so frequently linked with quasars?"
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"What the hell is a quasar? Just put a neat cross through it and we'll do the next one, OK?"
1,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"And I think that confidently and concisely answers the question, "What does the red spectrum tell us about quasars?""
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Da-daaaaaa!"
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Lister! Did you make that?"
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah. It's not that good, it was supposed to be roast beef. Do you want some, Cat? It's got some real cream and fudge in it."
1,3,CAT,-0.500000,"Gaaahhh. I think I'm going to have to go and do something secret."
1,3,CAT,0.333333,"Aaahhh! Look out! Food escape!"
1,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Well, Lister. You're doing all right, then?"
1,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Not bad. Not bad at all."
1,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Listen, Lister. All this tension between us is stupid. There's just no need for it. I mean, you're tense, and I'm tense, and there's just absolutely no need for it."
1,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"I'm not tense."
1,3,RIMMER,-0.666667,"Of course you're tense, you rectum-faced pygmy!  Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I mean, there's no need for you to be slogging your guts out."
1,3,LISTER,1.000000,"I'm enjoying it."
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Shut up! Doing an exam, and doing so well. There's absolutely no need for it, Lister. You can have the cigarettes, they're in pipeline 22."
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"I know."
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Good. The Cat betrayed me. I don't mind. I'm delighted.  What I'm saying, Lister, is there's no need for us to be at loggerheads. I mean we're mates. We're pals."
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Since when?"
1,3,RIMMER,0.666667,"Oh, come on, Lister! Laugh, laugh, laugh, chuckle, guffaw, giggle! That's Rimsy and Listy!"
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"When?"
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Millions of times!"
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"*When*?"
1,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Ah ... ah, how about the time your safety harness snapped and you fell into the cargo bay? We laughed then, didn't we?"
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"I broke me spine in three places."
1,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"Yes, but it was hilarious! We laughed like drains!"
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"*You* laughed. I spent six weeks in traction."
1,3,RIMMER,0.333333,"Yes, that's right, that's right! And you spent the rest of the summer walking around like a croquet hoop! Oh, I laughed so hard I nearly puked, I really did."
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"What are you saying to me, Rimmer?"
1,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I'm just saying, Lister, that with times as good as those, there's no point in letting something small and silly like this come between a friendship that we've nurtured like a small flower, petal by petal, and watched blossom and bloom into something rare and special."
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"OK, give me Kochanski."
1,3,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Smeg off! Dishwasher-breath! You won't turn me back on!"
1,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"What, Rimsy-Wimsy-Mimsy, me bestest ever pal?"
1,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"All right, Lister, I *order* you not to take those exams!"
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Black card, Rimmer."
1,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"*You* are black-carding *me*?"
1,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"That's only the beginning, Rimmer. When I pass the exams and become an officer, you'll be on latrines. You'll have the three o'clock watch every morning. I know you'll obey me, because you, I mean *you*, respect all that officer smeg."
1,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"If you mean I respect my superiors no matter who they are, and I obey orders blindly and unquestioningly ... yes! Yes I do!"
1,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"That's exactly what I mean. Anyway, got to get some sleep, hard days revision on the morrow."
1,3,RIMMER,-0.750000,"You always become the thing you hate the most. Look at you, Lister. Obnoxious, ruthless, single-minded, insensitive. You're more like me than I am."
1,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Rimmer, you've forgotten the colour code. This is a black card situation, end of conversation."
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"You never learn, do you?"
1,3,HOLLY,0.500000,"Chef Part 1 examination. Please proceed to the teaching room."
1,3,RIMMER,-0.333333,"You're not ready for it, you know. Look at you. You should be doing last-second revision."
1,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"I am. I'm revising buns."
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"I mean, it's obscene! Missing the entire first minute of the exam!"
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"OK, here we go."
1,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"No. You can't do this to me, Lister."
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Give me Kochanski."
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"No."
1,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"That was a lousy thing to do to a hologram. Have you no respect for the dead?"
1,3,LISTER,0.200000,"*Aaahhh!* Eee! Aaa! Ooo! I'm just doing this errmm, I'm taking this errmm, this is a surprise."
1,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"'Cause I'm a dope. And I'm a bum, and I'm stupid, and I'm an idiot, and I'm hopeless, and I'm useless."
1,3,LISTER,-0.333333,"Oh, hey. I'm really embarrassed now. I don't know what to say."
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Well, yeah. It's sort of pointless me breathing in and out, if you want to know the truth."
1,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"So, it didn't mean anything to you, then?"
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"You know, when we made love on the snooker table behind the bins."
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"I thought you might have noticed."
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"We've never made love. Go away, Rimmer."
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"A woman's period?! Women don't speak like that! Give me a break! I don't know how you've done it, Rimmer, but that is not Kochanski."
1,3,LISTER,0.500000,"The difference is that *you're* in there! Ugh!"
1,3,LISTER,1.000000,"Leave!"
1,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Er, Holly, this is not my breast. I want my own nipple back, Holly."
1,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"*Leave*, Rimmer!"
1,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"There's no rush, Holly."
1,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"Holly, are you *sure* these are my hips?"
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Lister 169-12-14-6."
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"How did you do?"
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"How did you do?"
1,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"How did you do, Lister?"
1,3,LISTER,0.000000,"How did I do, Mr. Lister, *sir*!"
1,4,HOLLY,-0.666667,"This is an SOS distress call from the mining ship Red Dwarf. The crew are dead, killed by a radiation leak. The only survivors were Dave Lister, who was in suspended animation during the disaster, and his pregnant cat, who was safely sealed in the hold. Revived three million years later, Lister's only companions are a life form who evolved from his cat, and Arnold Rimmer, a hologram simulation of one of the dead crew. The most interesting event that happened recently was that Lister pretended he passed the chef's exam, although really he failed. That gives you some idea of how truly exciting some days can be around here."
1,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Holly, give me access to the crew's confidential reports."
1,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"Those are for the Captain's eyes only, Arnold."
1,4,RIMMER,-0.666667,"Fine. Well, we'll give him ten seconds to come back from the dead, and if he hasn't managed it, we'll presume I'm in charge. No, he hasn't managed it."
1,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"Whose do you want?"
1,4,RIMMER,0.500000,"Give me ... give me Lister's. Just the remarks."
1,4,HOLLY,-0.500000,"David Lister, Technician, 3rd class. Captain's remarks: "Has requested sick leave due to diarrhea on no less than 500 occasions. Left his previous job as a supermarket trolley attendant after ten years because he didn't want to get tied down to a career. Promotion prospects: zero.""
1,4,RIMMER,0.500000,"I always liked Captain Hollister. Such a great reader of men, was Captain Hollister. A marvellous, marvellous man and a tragic loss to us all. All right, Holly, give me ... give me mine."
1,4,HOLLY,-0.500000,"Arnold Rimmer, Technician, 2nd Class. Captain's remarks: "There's a saying amongst the officers: If a job's worth doing, it's worth doing well. If it's not worth doing, give it to Rimmer. He aches for responsibility but constantly fails the engineering exam.""
1,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, Holly, Holly. I want *my* report. Rimmer. Two M's, E, R."
1,4,HOLLY,-0.250000,""Astoundingly zealous. Possibly mad. Probably has more teeth than brain cells. Promotion prospects: comical.""
1,4,RIMMER,-0.333333,"No no no no no, Holly. I want *Rimmer*. That's two R's, one at the front, one at the back."
1,4,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Arnold, this *is* your report."
1,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"I always hated that pus-head Hollister. He always resented my popularity. That's why he never put forward my proposal to reduce the minimum haircut length by an eighth of an inch. Small-minded, petty- thinking modo."
1,4,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Arnold, I'm picking up an unidentified object."
1,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Constantly fails the exam? I'd hardly call eleven times "constantly." I mean, if you eat roast beef eleven times in your life, one would hardly say that person constantly eats roast beef. No, it would be a rare, nay, freak occurrence. Possibly mad? What is he dribbling about?"
1,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"It's on the screen, Arnold."
1,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"What is?"
1,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"The U.O."
1,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"What is it?"
1,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"I don't know."
1,4,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Well, you'd better find out, hadn't you? It's obviously beyond me. I've got more teeth than brain cells, remember?"
1,4,HOLLY,1.000000,"Yes, you have."
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Uh-Uhm."
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Uh-Uhm."
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"No."
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Nothing!"
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Ssshhh!"
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"I *do* like toast!"
1,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Look, I'm busy!"
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"I don't want any!!"
1,4,LISTER,1.000000,"Good."
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Will you shut up?!"
1,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"What are you doing?!"
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"I'm reading."
1,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"What? With your nose?"
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah. It's a Cat book. They don't use marks, they use smells. You run your nose along the line and all the different smells are released. It's really good."
1,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"What a pathetic idea."
1,4,LISTER,1.000000,"Well, unlike you, Rimmer, my mind is open to new cultures, and new ways of looking at and doing things."
1,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"And what does it say?"
1,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"It says, "See [sniff] Dick [sniff] run. [sniff] Run, [sniff] Dick, [sniff] run. [sniff] Run [sniff sniff sniff] home [sniff] Dick.""
1,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"That's the Cat equivalent of Shakespeare, is it?"
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Shakespeare? Who's Shakespeare?"
1,4,RIMMER,-0.333333,"You moron. A playwright in the olden days. Wilfred Shakespeare."
1,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"I'm only just starting out. This is for three year olds, so you should try it."
1,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I'm not the slightest bit interested in smelling anything cats have to say, thank you, Lister."
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"You don't know what you're missing. Rimmer, there's this brilliant one where Dick buys this ball, this big ball, this big red ball. It's amazing stuff."
1,4,RIMMER,-0.333333,"You ought to try reading your shirt sometime, Lister. It's probably a novel by Victor Hugo. Anyway, if you're interested, Holly's spotted... Is that my shirt?!"
1,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"Yeah. I borrowed it."
1,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"What's that down the front?"
1,4,LISTER,1.000000,"That's definitely biscuit, um, that's custard, that's definitely ink, and just general sort of dirty marks."
1,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"You can't just go through my possessions!"
1,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Come on, you don't need them any more."
1,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Because I'm dead?"
1,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"Yeah. You're a hologram, and holograms don't need clothes."
1,4,RIMMER,-0.750000,"They're my things, Lister! Would you steal verruca cream from a man with no feet? I mean, how would you like it if I stole your T- shirt? Your favourite one, with the custard stains down the front?"
1,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"I wouldn't care."
1,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"You've got no right to go through my wardrobe."
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"OK, OK. You keep your underpants on coathangers, don't ya?"
1,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"That's private!"
1,4,LISTER,0.500000,"OK, Rimmer, OK. Take the shirt back."
1,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I don't want it. It's ruined. You've *sweated* in it."
1,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well, if you don't want the shirt, what do you want, Rimmer?"
1,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Just keep out of my things, all right?"
1,4,LISTER,0.500000,"OK, OK. What's Holly spotted?"
1,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"An unidentified object."
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"You mean a rock."
1,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"It might not be."
1,4,LISTER,1.000000,"They're always rocks."
1,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Mostly they're rocks, I agree, but maybe this one's different."
1,4,LISTER,-0.166667,"Rimmer, there's nothing out there, you know. There's nobody out there. No alien monsters, no Zargon warships, no beautiful blondes with beehive hairdos who say, "Show me some more of this Earth thing called kissing." There's just you, me, the Cat, and a lot of floating smegging rocks. That's it. Finito."
1,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Lister, if there's no one out there, what's the point in existence? Why are we here?"
1,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"Arnold, the unidentified object is now in visual range."
1,4,RIMMER,0.500000,"All right, Holly. I'm on my way."
1,4,CAT,0.250000,"Aaaoooww! Nice jump. Heeyyy! Smooth with a capital smoo. OK. Time to get out the food detector.  Food ... this way. Aaaooowww ... ooohhh ... yeah yeah..."
1,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Ah. You. Where have you been?"
1,4,CAT,0.000000,"Investigating. Investigating this, investigating that. General investigation."
1,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"General investigation, eh?"
1,4,CAT,0.000000,"Yeah."
1,4,RIMMER,2.000000,"Ahhhh, splendid!"
1,4,CAT,1.000000,"Thank you."
1,4,RIMMER,1.000000,"Keep it up."
1,4,CAT,0.000000,"OK."
1,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Fine. Well, ah, if you'll just excuse me."
1,4,CAT,0.333333,"Hey! You can't have my shiny thing! I found it, it's my shiny thing."
1,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"What are you dribbling about?"
1,4,CAT,-1.000000,"This is my shiny thing, and if you try and take it off me, I may have to eat you."
1,4,RIMMER,1.000000,"It's a yo-yo, you modo."
1,4,CAT,1.000000,"It does two amazing things. One, you have the shiny thing at the top, and the string down below, or, and this is the clever part, you have the string at the top, and the shiny thing down here where the string used to be."
1,4,RIMMER,0.500000,"Yeah ... woweeee! You haven't the slightest clue what it's for, do you?"
1,4,CAT,0.285714,"Why sure I do, grease stain. You hold the shiny thing in one hand, and you go ... aaaooowww! The string's moving! Hey! Stop that thing! Catch that string! Aaaooowww!"
1,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Where is it?"
1,4,HOLLY,1.000000,"It's in scoop range, Arnold."
1,4,RIMMER,1.000000,"It's a pod! Holly, bring it in!"
1,4,CAT,0.500000,"Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm back! Feeling good!  Feed me."
1,4,LISTER,-0.333333,"Cat, hi. I haven't seen you for ages. Where have you been?"
1,4,CAT,0.000000,"Investigating."
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Got you some crispies."
1,4,CAT,1.000000,"Yeah, yeah, yeah!"
1,4,LISTER,0.333333,"I read the book you gave me, you know. It's got a brilliant ending. I could hardly believe me nose."
1,4,CAT,0.000000,"Oh, forget that. Got you this. The one you asked about. The Holy Book."
1,4,LISTER,0.666667,"Oh, great!  Hey! Pictures!"
1,4,CAT,0.333333,"Yeah! That's a Cat thing. You see, sometimes, in a book, we have a drawing of something that is happening in the story, and we call them "pictures.""
1,4,LISTER,1.000000,"Yeah, yeah, we have pictures too."
1,4,CAT,1.000000,"Hey, you monkeys are smarter than I thought."
1,4,LISTER,1.000000,"This is me!"
1,4,CAT,0.000000,"No, that's not you, that's Cloister. He was the father of the Cat people. He lived years ago, at the Beginning."
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Who's that?"
1,4,CAT,0.000000,"That's him frozen in time."
1,4,LISTER,-0.666667,"No, that's *me*! I was sent into stasis. That's what "frozen in time" is."
1,4,CAT,0.000000,"He did that to save Frankenstein."
1,4,LISTER,0.500000,"Look, Frankenstein was my pet cat!  Look, Lister, Cloister. Cloister, Lister! See?"
1,4,CAT,-1.000000,"Listen, you stupid monkey, Cloister's another name for ... for God!"
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"That's what I'm saying! I am your God!"
1,4,CAT,0.000000,"OK.  Turn this into a woman."
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"I'm serious."
1,4,CAT,0.000000,"So am I!"
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Look, Frankenstein was my pet cat, right? And she was pregnant. Now, I got put into suspended animation. I was supposed to be there for 18 months, but I didn't get out for three million years."
1,4,CAT,0.000000,"You oversleep? So do I."
1,4,LISTER,0.500000,"No! What I'm saying is that over those three million years, your entire race of people evolved from my pet cat."
1,4,CAT,-0.500000,"Ah, I gotta go now, man. But let's do lunch sometime. I'll put it in my diary: 12:30, lunch with God. And, ah, formal dress, you know what I'm saying?"
1,4,LISTER,1.000000,"It is true, you know."
1,4,CAT,0.000000,"Yeah? Then I gotta ask you the ultimate question. If you're God, why that face?"
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"What's wrong with me face?"
1,4,CAT,-0.333333,"What's wrong with your face? It's upside down and inside out, that's what's wrong with it. Aaaooowww!"
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Holly?"
1,4,HOLLY,1.000000,"Yes, Dave?"
1,4,LISTER,1.000000,"If I give you my Cat dictionary, can you translate this for me?"
1,4,HOLLY,1.000000,"Oh, I'll give it a go, Dave."
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"You're a toaster."
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"No, by nature you're a toaster."
1,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Lister, it's arrived!"
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"What has?"
1,4,RIMMER,0.500000,"The U.O.! It's a pod!"
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Where?"
1,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"The observation room."
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Yes!"
1,4,RIMMER,0.400000,"Ah, no point in running, Lister. It's mine. I found it. I've got bagsies.  He's such a child, that boy."
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Is it safe, Holly?"
1,4,HOLLY,1.000000,"Yes, Dave."
1,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Lister, no point in running. I found it and it's mine."
1,4,LISTER,-0.333333,"Calm down. Dead people can have heart attacks too, you know. What is it?"
1,4,RIMMER,0.666667,"I don't know. It's obviously some sort of alien capsule, and clearly they're intelligent, Lister. Ah, the chance to meet an intelligent life form, after 18 weeks alone with you."
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"OK, Mr. Intelligence, what are those markings?"
1,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"I don't know. I don't speak alien, you gimboid."
1,4,RIMMER,-0.250000,"What are you doing, Lister? We don't know if it's safe! It's quarantined! You might get some squiggly, slimy thing stuck to your face!"
1,4,LISTER,-0.333333,"Of course it's safe. Come in, come on, come in. Ahh--"
1,4,RIMMER,0.166667,"Ha ha ha. Tee hee. All right, Lister, we'll play it your way. But don't think you're coming out of there! You're in there for a month. You're in quarantine."
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"What did you say, Rimmer?"
1,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Why do you never do what I tell you? Don't you think there's a shining good reason why I'm your superior?"
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah. You've been with the company for 15 years--"
1,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"No it's not."
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"--And I've been with them for eight months."
1,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"No it's not. It's because I'm better than you. Better trained, better equipped, better ... better! Just, just better."
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"That must mean the rest of the crew are better than you then."
1,4,RIMMER,-0.800000,"No it doesn't! It means ... I'm not going to let you bait me, Lister. This is far too important. Just you wait here, keep that door closed till I get back with the skutters. Tyke."
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Oh, Rimmer, he's such a smeghead, man.  Hang on a minute!"
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Give me an R, give me an E, give me a D ... give me a Red Dwarf Garbage Pod! Holly? Did Rimmer never work in waste disposal?"
1,4,HOLLY,-1.000000,"No, Dave."
1,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"It's one of our Red Dwarf garbage pods with, like, the writing burnt off in places. Why didn't you tell him?"
1,4,HOLLY,1.000000,"Well, it's a laugh, innit?"
1,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"After intensive investigation, comma, of the markings on the alien pod, comma, it has become clear, comma, to me, comma, that we are dealing, comma, with a species of awesome intellect, colon."
1,4,HOLLY,0.500000,"Good. Perhaps they might be able to give you a hand with your punctuation."
1,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Shut up."
1,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Lights!"
1,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Lister, are you awake? Lister? Lister?  *LISTER!!!!!*"
1,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Are you awake?"
1,4,LISTER,1.000000,"Yeah, yeah."
1,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Yeah, I couldn't sleep either. The excitement!"
1,4,LISTER,1.000000,"What excitement?"
1,4,RIMMER,1.000000,"The alien excitement!"
1,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Rimmer, it's garbage."
1,4,RIMMER,0.200000,"You can scoff, Lister. That's nothing new. They laughed at Galileo. They laughed at Edison. They laughed at Columbo."
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Who's Columbo?"
1,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"The man with the dirty mac who discovered America."
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"What makes you think these aliens exist?"
1,4,RIMMER,-0.333333,"They must do, Lister! There's so many things that are strange and odd. So many things we don't have any explanation for."
1,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"Like, um, why do intelligent people buy cinema hot dogs? Do you mean that sort of weird and mysterious thing?"
1,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"No, Lister, I mean like the pyramids. How did they move such massive pieces of stone without the aid of modern technology?"
1,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"They had massive whips, Rimmer. Massive, massive whips."
1,4,RIMMER,0.333333,"All right, then, the Bermuda Triangle. Go on, explain that one. You know all the answers."
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"No, I agree there. That is a genuine mystery. How did a song like that ever become a hit? It defies all reason."
1,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"I just don't know why I bother. I'd get more sense out of a squashed hedgehog. Lister, don't you ever stop and wonder: why are we here? What's the grand purpose?"
1,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"Why does it have to be such a big deal? Why can't it be like, like, human beings are a planetary disease? Like the Earth's got German measles or facial herpes, right? And that's why all of the other planets give us such a wide berth. It's like, "Oh, don't go near Earth! It's got human beings on it, they're contagious!""
1,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"So you're saying, Lister, you're an intergalactic, pus-filled cold sore! At last, Lister, we agree on something."
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"What do you believe in, then? Do you believe in God?"
1,4,RIMMER,-0.250000,"God? Certainly not! What a preposterous thought! I believe in aliens, Lister."
1,4,LISTER,0.500000,"Oh, right, fine. Something sensible at last."
1,4,RIMMER,1.000000,"Aliens, Lister, with technology so far in advance of our own we can't even begin to imagine."
1,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well, that's not difficult. Mankind hasn't even got the technology to create a toupee that doesn't get big laughs."
1,4,RIMMER,1.000000,"Aliens, Lister, who can give me a real body."
1,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Ooohhh, I can't wait to see your face in the morning, I really can't."
1,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"And nor I yours, Lister. When that pod opens and from it emerges a beautiful alien woman with long green hair and six breasts."
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Six breasts?! Imagine making love to a woman with six breasts!"
1,4,RIMMER,1.000000,"Imagine making love to a woman!"
1,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"Bonjourno. Um, give me breakfast."
1,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Uh ... chicken vindaloo ... and a milkshake."
1,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Um ... beer."
1,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"Morning, Dave. I've finished your translation."
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Who's Cloister? Is it me?"
1,4,HOLLY,0.500000,"Yes, Dave. The Cats have made you their God."
1,4,LISTER,1.000000,"Hey! Working class kid makes good!"
1,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"Your plan to buy a farm on Fiji and open up a hot dog and doughnut diner has become their image of heaven."
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"What?"
1,4,HOLLY,1.000000,""And Cloister spake, `Lo, I shall lead you to Fyushal, and there we shall open a temple of food, wherein shall be sausages and doughnuts and all manner of bountiful things."
1,4,HOLLY,0.000000,""`Yea, even individual sachets of mustard. And those who serve shall have hats of great majesty, yea, though they be made of coloured cardboard and have humorous arrows through the top.'""
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Does it say what happened to the rest of the Cats?"
1,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"Holy wars. There were thousands of years of fighting, Dave, between the two factions."
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"What two factions?"
1,4,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Well, the ones who believed the hats should be red, and the ones who believed the hats should be blue."
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Do you mean they had a war over whether the doughnut diner hats were red or blue?"
1,4,HOLLY,-0.333333,"Yeah. Most of them were killed fighting about that. It's daft really, innit?"
1,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"You're not kidding. They were supposed to be green."
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Go on, Hol."
1,4,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Well, finally they called a truce, and built two arks and left Red Dwarf in search of Fyushal."
1,4,LISTER,-0.666667,"But there's no such place as Fyushal. It's Fiji. I mean, how are they supposed to find it?"
1,4,HOLLY,-1.000000,""And Cloister gave to Frankenstein the sacred writing, saying, `Those who have wisdom will know its meaning.' And it was written thus: `Seven socks, one shirt--'""
1,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"That's my laundry list! I lined the cat's basket with me laundry list!"
1,4,HOLLY,-1.000000,"The Blue Hats thought it was a star chart leading to the promised land."
1,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well it wasn't, it was my dirty washing."
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"What happened next, Hol?"
1,4,HOLLY,-1.000000,""And the ark that left first followed the sacred signs, and lo, they flew straight into an asteroid."
1,4,HOLLY,-1.000000,""And the righteous in the second ark flew ever onward, knowing they were indeed righteous.""
1,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"This is terrible. Holy wars. Killing. They're just using religion as an excuse to be extremely crappy to each other."
1,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I'm not interested."
1,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"And they killed each other over which coloured cardboard hat to wear."
1,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I'm not interested."
1,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"But don't you think it's amazing?"
1,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Nope."
1,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"You know what happened to people who didn't eat hot dogs on Fyushal Day? They were stoned to death by stale doughnuts."
1,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Lister, what do you want me to say? "Congratulations, you're God?""
1,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"I'm talking about the suffering. People died, I mean cats died, Cat people died."
1,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"You've just come here to rub my nose in it. I could have been God, you know, given a different start in life, given the lucky show- biz break you had."
1,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"I don't want to be a god. That's the point."
1,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Oh, vomitisation! I don't believe it! "I'm God, but it's a bit of a drag, actually?" Come on!"
1,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"I'm not a god! I've just been ... misquoted."
1,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Lister, for my money, anyone who goes around reading meaning into any old gobbledygook deserves everything they get."
1,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"I mean, if I'd had eight socks on my laundry list instead of seven, or if I owned more than one pair of underpants, they might have been safe. I just wish I could meet them and explain and apologise."
1,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Well, that would look spectacular, wouldn't it, Lister? God returns in all his splendour, and says, "Sorry, it's all been a total cock-up!""
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"I didn't ask for this. I didn't ask to become their God."
1,4,RIMMER,-0.666667,"Well, I didn't ask to be killed, Lister. Life's a bitch. Now smeg off, I'm busy."
1,4,LISTER,-0.800000,"I mean, they just made stuff up, you know. I'm supposed to have given them five sacred laws. Five sacred laws! I've broken four of them meself. I'd have broken the fifth, but there's no sheep on board."
1,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Bye-bye."
1,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"I mean, Rimmer, what sort of Holy Writ is this, Rimmer: "It is a sin to be cool.""
1,4,RIMMER,-0.600000,"Look, I'm sick of hearing about these stupid cats! My concerns are slightly more meaningful than what coloured stupid smegging cardboard hat I'm wearing! I'm trying to decipher this! This is science, laddie! You can smirk, Lister, but I believe the Quagaars--"
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Quagars?"
1,4,RIMMER,0.750000,"Quagaaaars! It's a name I made up! Double A, actually! I believe the Quagaars have the technology to give me a new body!"

1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Tot!!"
1,4,RIMMER,1.000000,"We'll soon see how totty it is, laddie, the quarantine period's nearly up! Bastard!"
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Cat? *Cat!* Holly, where's the Cat?"
1,4,HOLLY,-1.000000,"He's no longer in my supervision field, Dave."
1,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"He's gone down to the cargo decks."

1,4,CAT,0.500000,"I'm telling you about my feet! My investigating feet."
1,4,CAT,0.500000,"Yeah. But I'm telling you about my feet."
1,4,CAT,-1.000000,"I'm not listening to you. I'm trying to tell you about my feet."
1,4,CAT,-1.000000,"I don't care! You're the one who's doing the dying, not me. Why should I let it spoil my evening?"
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Cat? ... Cat?"
1,4,LISTER,-0.250000,"Oohh. Cat, when I get you I'm going to turn you into a kebab. Holly? Can you still hear me?"
1,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Cat...?"
1,4,CAT,0.000000,"That's a fearsome hat."
1,4,CAT,0.000000,"It's burnt."
1,4,LISTER,1.000000,"It is I, Cloister!"
1,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"I told you, it's me, Cloister. I've returned from the dead."

1,4,CAT,1.000000,"Yeah, yeah!"
1,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Why didn't you go on the arks with the rest of the Cats?"
1,4,CAT,0.000000,"What idiot?"
1,4,CAT,0.000000,"My father was a jelly-brain?"
1,4,CAT,1.000000,"I did wonder."
1,4,LISTER,-0.250000,"Oh, no. You didn't fail, old man. You passed! I'm giving you ... I'm giving you an A+ distinction."
1,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"A place? Got your own bathroom, own suite, cork floors, your own barbecue on the patio, double glazing, a phone, everything!"
1,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"No you haven't!"
1,4,CAT,0.000000,"Did I ever tell you about my feet? My investigating feet? Once upon a time, there was an old man..."
1,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"Well? Are you ready for this, Rimmer?"
1,4,RIMMER,1.000000,"Open it! Open it!"
1,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Well? What's there?"
1,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Are you *sure* you're ready for this, Rimmer?"
1,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Yes, come on, you gimboid!"
1,4,RIMMER,0.333333,"Incredible! A stupendous moment in my own personal history! The perfectly preserved remains of a Quagaar warrior!"
1,4,LISTER,0.500000,"Yeah, right, Rimmer. Absolutely."
1,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"They must have looked something like ... a roast chicken."
1,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"It's a garbage pod!"
1,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"IT'S A SMEGGING GARBAGE POD!!"
1,5,HOLLY,-0.666667,"This is an SOS distress call from the mining ship Red Dwarf. The crew are dead, killed by a radiation leak. The only survivors were Dave Lister, who was in suspended animation during the disaster, and his pregnant cat, who was safely sealed in the hold. Revived three million years later, Lister's only companions are a life form who evolved from his cat, and Arnold Rimmer, a hologram simulation of one of the dead crew. We have been travelling through the galaxy now for three million years and there are many things we've discovered. The highest form of life in the universe is Man and the lowest is a man who works for the post office."

1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Hol! I'm watching the film."
1,5,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Just wondered if you're a bit bored?"

1,5,HOLLY,1.000000,""Football, It's a Funny Old Game" by Kevin Keegan."
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Holly, would you let me watch the film?"
1,5,HOLLY,-0.500000,"I'm at a loose end now. I don't know what to do with meself."
1,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Holly, why don't you just read everything all over again."
1,5,HOLLY,-1.000000,"I was thinking it might help pass the time if I created a perfectly functioning replica of a woman, capable of independent decision-making and abstract thought and absolutely undetectable from the real thing."
1,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well why don't you, then?"
1,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"Because I don't know how. I wouldn't even know how to make the nose. Heh."
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Holly, is there something that you want?"
1,5,HOLLY,-0.500000,"Well, only if you're not busy. Would you mind erasing some of my memory banks?"
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"What for?"
1,5,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Well, if you erase all the Agatha Christie novels from my memory bank, I can read 'em again tonight."
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"How do I do it?"
1,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"Just type, "HolMem. Password override. The novels Christie, Agatha." Then press erase."
1,5,LISTER,1.000000,"I've done it."
1,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"Done what?"
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Erased Agatha Christie."
1,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"Who's she, then?"
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Holly, you just asked me to erase all Agatha Christie novels from your memory."
1,5,HOLLY,-0.500000,"Why should I do that? I've never heard of her."
1,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"You've never heard of her because I've just erased her from your smegging memory."
1,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"What'd you do that for?"
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"You asked me to!"
1,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"When?"
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Just now!"
1,5,HOLLY,-1.000000,"I don't remember this."
1,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Oh, I'm going to bed. This is gonna go on all night."
1,5,RIMMER,-0.285714,"Off!  Ah! Had a good day, Lister? Scrummed enough choccies? Watched enough drivel, have you? Look at you: you're turning into a sad, middle-aged woman. Next thing you know you'll be varnishing your nails and buying girdles."
1,5,LISTER,0.500000,"Oh yeah? And what've you done that's so great?"
1,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I've achieved seventeen things today off my daily goal list, whereas you've never achieved anything ever in your entire life."
1,5,LISTER,-0.500000,"Don't know, you know. I went to the Officer's Block."
1,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"When?!"
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"This morning."
1,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"But it hasn't been decontaminated!"
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"You said it had last week!"
1,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"No, I said it was on last Thursday's daily goal list!"
1,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"And you haven't done it yet?!"
1,5,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Tomorrow. It's on tomorrow's daily goal list. Item 34, right after "Learn Portugese.""
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Thanks a lot. Don't tell *me*."
1,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Why were you mooching around up there, anyway?"
1,5,LISTER,0.333333,"I was looking through Kochanski's dream recorder. She dreamt about me three times, you know. It was in the log."
1,5,RIMMER,0.500000,"So? Clean my teeth, please, Holly."
1,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"I mean, it must mean something. You don't dream about someone that you don't feel something for."
1,5,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Lister, I once had a dream about a babboon but that doesn't mean I want to go to bed with it. Shave, please, Holly.  Lister, you ought to take a good long look at yourself and then you'd see just how ridiculous you appear to other people."
1,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"If you'd let me have Kochanski's personality disk for like one second, maybe I could find out."
1,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Lister, if you were a Love Celibate like me you wouldn't have these problems."
1,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Come on, Rimmer, the only reason you knocked around with those prats from the Love Celibacy Society was you could never get a date."
1,5,RIMMER,0.500000,"No, it wasn't. I happen to agree with their philosophy that love is a sickness that holds back your career and makes you want to spend all your money."
1,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"You could never get a date because you let your mum buy all your casual clothes."
1,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"There is nothing wrong with my casual clothes."
1,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Oh, come on, Rimmer, your trousers were so short when you crossed your legs, you could see your knees."
1,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"What about Yvonne MacGruder? That was a date."
1,5,LISTER,1.000000,"She'd been hit on the head by a winch, she had a concussion."
1,5,RIMMER,-0.500000,"That's got nothing to do with it. She was crazy about me."
1,5,LISTER,0.500000,"Oh, yeah? She kept calling you "Norman.""
1,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"She still went to bed with me."
1,5,LISTER,1.000000,"Yeah, because she had wonky vision and she thought you were somebody else."
1,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Serves her right for being concussed, doesn't it?"
1,5,LISTER,-0.500000,"Rimmer! You don't know what love is."
1,5,RIMMER,0.333333,"Yes, I do. Love is a device invented by bank managers to make us overdrawn. Lights!"
1,5,LISTER,1.000000,"Rimmer... Love is what makes us different from animals."
1,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"No, Lister, what makes us different from animals is we don't use our tongues to clean our own genitals."
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Lights!  Rimmer, are you awake? Rimmer! Are you awake?!"
1,5,RIMMER,-0.250000,"What? Yes, Mum, I'm just packing my satchel. Where am I? What time is it?"
1,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"I don't feel very well."
1,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Half past three?!"
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"I feel really ill."
1,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Well, you are really ill."
1,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"No, I mean, *really* ill.  I'm going down to the medical unit. I don't feel very well."
1,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Lights!  Ah, Miss MacGruder, where were we?"
1,5,LISTER,1.000000,"I feel really hot."
1,5,CAT,-0.272727,"Hey, this is mine. That's mine. All this is mine. I'm claiming all this as mine. Except that bit. I don't want that bit. But all the rest of this is mine. Hey, this has been a good day. I've eaten five times, I've slept six times, and I've made a lot of things mine. Tomorrow, I'm gonna see if I can't have *sex* with something.  Oooooooooow, yeaaaaaaah..."
1,5,CAT,0.111111,"S-E-X, you know I want it! S-E-X, I'm gonna get it! S-E-X, I think I found it!  Oh, it's you! Hey, monkey, you're sick. Sick, helpless, and unconscious. If you weren't my friend, I'd steal your shoes.  Time for a snack. This way."
1,5,HOLLY,-0.500000,"Emergency. There's an emergency going on. It's still going on. It's still an emergency. Will Arnold Rimmer please hurry to White Corridor 159. This is an emergency announcement."
1,5,CAT,0.000000,"Food!"
1,5,CAT,-1.000000,"I'm gonna eat you little chickie. I'm gonna eat you little chickie. I'm gonna eat you little chickie."
1,5,CAT,-1.000000,"Uh uh, too slow, chicken merango. Too slow for this cat."
1,5,CAT,0.500000,"Hey! This chicken is faster than I thought!"
1,5,RIMMER,0.750000,"Quick! Lister's fainted! He needs help! Quick!"
1,5,RIMMER,-0.125000,"Didn't you hear me? Didn't anyone hear me? Lister's in trouble. The monkey, oo oo oo, has fainted. I can not pick him up. Quick! Come on! Now!"
1,5,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Is there something wrong with you? Lister's collapsed!"
1,5,CAT,0.000000,"Yeah?"
1,5,RIMMER,0.500000,"What do you mean "yeah?" He needs help!"
1,5,CAT,0.000000,"And?"
1,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"And if you don't help him he might die."
1,5,CAT,-0.333333,"Aw, no. That's too bad. I really liked him, too."
1,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"So, come and help him."
1,5,CAT,-0.500000,"What? And interrupt my lunch?!"
1,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"What is more important: a man's life or your smegging lunch?"
1,5,CAT,-1.000000,"That doesn't even deserve an answer."
1,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Right. Okay. Fine.  You come with me. You get a stretcher."
1,5,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Down. Down. Okay, stop."
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Let the medicomp take me temperature."
1,5,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Lister, they've got to learn. Down, down, slowly now. Ah ah, now very, very, very slowly forward."
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"AIGH! Me eye!"
1,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Lister, they've got to learn."
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"I just nearly lost an eye!"
1,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"How about an anal reading?"
1,5,LISTER,1.000000,"I'm all right! I feel fine now."
1,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Well, you're not fine. And it's your own smegging fault for going up to the Officer's Deck before it was decontaminated."
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"I just wanted to have a look around."
1,5,RIMMER,0.500000,"You just wanted to go into Kochanski's quarters and wallow in self-pity. And look what's it got you!"
1,5,LISTER,0.666667,"I'm all right. I've got a touch of pneumonia. That's all."
1,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"It's not pneumonia. Three million years ago it was pneumonia but since then it's bred and mutated and now we don't know what it is."
1,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Why didn't I ask her out? What's the worst she could've said?"
1,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"She could've said, "No, you're a filthy, stinking, loathsome, disgusting object I wouldn't be seen dead with in a plague pit.""
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"She could've said, "yes." Stranger things have happened!"
1,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Only two spring to mind, Lister: the spontaneous combustion of the Mayor of Warsaw in 1546 and that incident in 12th century Burgandy when it rained herring."
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"There's this theory that Chen used to have. It's like everyone's got two people inside you. You've got your confidence and paranoia. And your confidence's the guy who goes, "Hey you're great. You're dead sexy! Everybody loves you!" And your paranoia says, "You're stupid. You're useless. You're ugly. And everybody hates you.""
1,5,RIMMER,-0.500000,"That's odd, Lister. According to this reading, you're clinically dead."
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"And what had happened was my confidence was just about to persuade me to ask Kochanski out and as I was walking up to her he'd go on a business trip to Hawaii or something and I'd be left with my paranoia saying, "You must be joking. She's gonna laugh in our face.""
1,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"You know, sometimes, Lister, you can be quite perceptive and thought-provoking. And other times, like this, you can rant and drivel on like a complete loonie."
1,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Just take me to me bed."
1,5,RIMMER,1.000000,"All right, Lister.  Okay, you know how it works. Now release the mechanism very, very, very gently."
1,5,RIMMER,1.000000,"Possibly a gnat's more gently than that."
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Quick! Get an umbrella. Get an umbrella. Quick, get an umbrella. Get an umbrella. Cor! Ungh..."
1,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,""Necrobics, Hologrammatic Exercises for the Dead.""
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"It's raining. It's raining down. Get an umbrella! It's raining. It's raining."
1,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Holly, what's going on?"
1,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"What?"
1,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"What's happening?"
1,5,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Um, Hercule Poirot's just stepped off the steaming train. And if you want my opinion, I think they all did it."
1,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Why did we have to have you as the ship's computer? We'd be better off with a bucket of sheep's slop running things."
1,5,HOLLY,-0.500000,"If you've got a complaint, just come straight out with it. Don't hide behind innuendo and hyperbole."
1,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Why is it raining fish in our sleeping quarters?!"
1,5,HOLLY,-0.500000,"I'd be lying if I said I knew. The only comparable incident on record is in 12th century Burgandy when it rained herring."
1,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"It really is gonna be one of those days."
1,5,CAT,0.000000,"Hey! You're awake!"

1,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Aw, you shouldn't have bothered."
1,5,CAT,0.400000,"Ha ha! Well, I'm that kind of guy! Hey, let's see what we've got in the magic bag here! I got you some grapes!  And I got you got you an orange!"
1,5,LISTER,1.000000,"Thanks a lot."
1,5,CAT,-0.250000,"That's all right. Hey, well, all this enormous generosity has made me tired. I'm going to bed.  Ah, yes, indeedy."
1,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"You're awake."
1,5,CAT,-1.000000,"Yeah, but I'll be asleep in a minute."

1,5,CAT,-0.666667,"Fine. Just don't ask me anymore questions. I'm trying to sleep!"
1,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Shut up! You stupid moggey! And out of that bed!"
1,5,CAT,-1.000000,"Well, if you're going to speak to me like that, I'm gonna take my presents back!"
1,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"How do you feel?"

1,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Listen, Lister, you had a fever, okay?"
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah?"
1,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"And, you started to hallucinate, all right?"
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah?"
1,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Only your hallucinations... were solid."
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"What do you mean, "solid?""
1,5,RIMMER,1.000000,"I mean they were real, alive, solid."
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Solid?"
1,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Solid."
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"What do you mean, "they were solid?""
1,5,RIMMER,0.500000,"Okay, I'll put it another way. You had hallucinations, all right?"
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah?"
1,5,RIMMER,0.250000,"And they were solid. I told you it wasn't ordinary pneumonia. I told you it was mutated. I knew something like this would happen."
1,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Okay, well, what did I hallucinate?"
1,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Well, first of all, it was fish rain."
1,5,LISTER,0.500000,"Fish rain? Yeah, I dreamt that!"
1,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Well, it actually happened!"
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Where's all the fish?"
1,5,CAT,0.000000,"Somebody ate them!"
1,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Then, the Mayor of Warsaw spontaneously combusted. And then you hallucinated two men in the Drive Room."
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"What two men?"
1,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Apparently, one of them's your confidence and the other's your paranoia."
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"You're my confidence?"
1,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"I don't get it. You look like the manager of the London Jets but you sound like Bing Baxter, the American quiz show host."
1,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"And you're my paranoia?"
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"What?  No, it isn't. It's tea."
1,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"You're insane.  Lister, what are you going to do about them?"
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Do? What can I do?"
1,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"I think we should arrest them."
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"What for?"
1,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"For being hallucinations."
1,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Come on, smeghead. It's a bit of company, isn't it?"
1,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Lister, you're still sick. These two are symptoms of your disease. They're like the spots in measles, the swellings in mumps, the funny walk in cystitis. Until they're gone, you won't be better."
1,5,RIMMER,-0.333333,"You are treading on a very thin line, me laddo. The "H" stands for "Hologram." I happen to be dead."
1,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"No, I forbid it!"
1,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Why?"
1,5,LISTER,1.000000,"Yeah, right!"
1,5,RIMMER,1.000000,"I don't believe it, he's socializing with a figment of his imagination."
1,5,HOLLY,-0.500000,"Please note the dust storm approaching. The surface of the ship is now out of bounds. All air locks are being automatically sealed. Estimated duration: eighteen hours."
1,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"...our love I tried to kindle, like firelight it... dwindled, now I wonder when this... wind'll ever... stop-----."
1,5,LISTER,1.000000,"Yeah, but that was ages ago, you know."
1,5,LISTER,1.000000,"Come on!"
1,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"What are you doing with that cigarette butt?"
1,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"You're serious, aren't you?"
1,5,LISTER,-0.333333,"I'm a nobody! Out of a hundred and sixty-nine people aboard this ship, I ranked one-six-nine. Bottom of the pile."
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"If she'd've come."
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Oh, we'll never know now."
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"She's dead."
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"I can't. Holly can only sustain one hologram and Rimmer's hidden all the other personality disks."
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"I can't."
1,5,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Oh, I know, I know. I'll bet five."
1,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"How?"
1,5,RIMMER,1.500000,"That is priceless! It really is."
1,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Oh, what a silly thing to call a gym master."
1,5,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Why do you hate him? Why do you talk about him so much?"
1,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"NOW! STAB HIM! STAB HIM! STAB HIM! QUICK! STAB HIM!"
1,5,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Uh, you haven't met "Stabem," have you? He's one of the scutters. Stabem, meet Lister's paranoia. Lister's paranoia, this is Stabem."
1,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Yo, Rimmer, listen, we've been thinking. We think we can get Kochanski back without turning you off."
1,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"All we have to do is turn off all non-essential power systems and Holly says it'll work."
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Not now!"
1,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Lister, you're not having her disk."
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Why? Because she'll rank above you?"
1,5,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Yes! Why should she be interested in you?"
1,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Yeah, why should she be interested in me?"
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Oh, yeah! I forgot. That's why she'd be interested in me."
1,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Lister, you're not having her disk or any disk."
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"I don't know."
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Outside. Outside the ship."
1,5,RIMMER,1.000000,"Uh... Wrong, actually!"
1,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well, he'd have to send the scutters... and the disks would have to be safe."
1,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Wrong, wrong, absolutely brimming over with wrong-ability."
1,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"And they'd have to be right under me nose he could laugh at me."
1,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Wrong and getting wronger all the time."
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Outside out sleeping quarters. The solar panel outside our sleeping quarters!"
1,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"You followed me, you goit!"
1,5,LISTER,0.333333,"Is that where they are?! That's incredible! I did it!"
1,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Lister?"
1,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"How long now, Hol?"
1,5,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Can't be long now, Dave. Hercule has got all the suspects in one room and I'm only too pages away from "Also by the same author.""
1,5,LISTER,-0.500000,"No, Holly. The dust storm."
1,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"Oh, that. Any time now, it's almost subsided."
1,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Let me ask you one question?"
1,5,LISTER,-0.500000,"It's no use arguing, Rimmer. I'm going."
1,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Who smashed up the medicomp?"
1,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Holly, give him a punch up."
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Look, what's in it for them, smashing up the medical unit?"
1,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Lister, come here. Come here.  You are still sick."
1,5,LISTER,1.000000,"I feel great."
1,5,RIMMER,-0.666667,"You will not... You will not... You will not be better until they've gone. They know that and now they've stopped you getting any treatment. Where's Paranoia?"
1,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Lister, they're germs and they're dangerous."
1,5,HOLLY,0.500000,"The storm has passed, Dave. Airlocks are now released."
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Nothing."
1,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Holly, put a trace on Paranoia."
1,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"What's a trace?"
1,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"It's space jargon. It means find him."
1,5,HOLLY,0.500000,"No, it doesn't. You just made it up to be cool."
1,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Where is he?"
1,5,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Paranoia is no longer aboard this ship."
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Hey, here it is!"
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Did you hear something?"
1,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"You don't think Paranoia could've got here first, do you?"
1,5,LISTER,1.000000,"He smashed up the medical unit."
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"What do you mean?"
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"*You* did?"
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"So where did he go, then?"
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"What do you mean, you "killed him, cha-cha-cha?!""
1,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Look, I'm gonna go inside now. Gets a little bit hot, you could get claustrophobic in these suits."
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"What?!"
1,5,LISTER,1.000000,"I'll die!"
1,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"There's no oxygen out here!"
1,5,LISTER,1.000000,"I *need* oxygen!"
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"You're crazy!"
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"NO!!!"
1,5,RIMMER,1.000000,"Must you do this now?"
1,5,CAT,0.000000,"I'm doing my laundry!"
1,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"It's totally disgusting."
1,5,CAT,-1.000000,"What's disgusting?"
1,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Lister."
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah?"
1,5,RIMMER,0.500000,"I just want to say, I was right all along. I said they were germs and they were germs."
1,5,LISTER,0.500000,"Yeah, okay. So what?"
1,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"And I'm just saying now, that disk will only bring you misery. I just want you to remember that I said that."
1,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Look, if she comes back and she's not interested, I can handle it."
1,5,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Whatever, Lister. I want it on record: that disk is a one-way ticket to Miseryville."
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah, well, I spent enough time listening to me paranoia. Now I'm gonna listen to me confidence."
1,5,LISTER,-0.333333,"Hi, Krissie. It's not gonna work. Hello, Krissie. That's not gonna work either.  Hey, yo, Krissie!  Hi..."
1,5,RIMMER,0.500000,"Lister, look, good luck. I mean it."
1,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Smeg off."
1,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"No, honestly, I mean it. Good luck."
1,5,LISTER,0.500000,"Okay, Hol. Switch it on."
1,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"I certainly did.  Do you honestly think I'd put Kochanski's disk in Kochanski's box where any Munchkin could find it? You think you had it bad before, Lister? Well now you've got it in stereo, baby.  Welcome aboard, Rimmsie."
1,6,HOLLY,-1.000000,"This is an SOS distress call from the mining ship Red Dwarf. The crew are dead, killed by a radiation leak. The only survivors were Dave Lister, who was in suspended animation during the disaster, and his pregnant cat, who was safely sealed in the hold. Revived three million years later, Lister's only companions are a life form who evolved from his cat, and Arnold Rimmer, a hologram simulation of one of the dead crew. We have enough food to last thirty thousand years but we've only got one After Eight mint left. And everyone's too polite to take it."

1,6,RIMMER,-0.500000,"What's so strange? You have videos of weddings and births."
1,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"So, what, do you have other people around, give 'em a sherry, and invite them to watch you snuff it?"
1,6,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Lister, my death is one of the most important things that ever happened to me. Just stick it in the trunk and shut up."

1,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Woa, they're mine!"

1,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"Oh, there's one of your old toenail clippings under the bed. I'll put that in too, shall I?"
1,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Ah, Lister, this is one the best decisions I ever made. No more *you* and your stupid, annoying face. No more *you* and your stupid, annoying habits."
1,6,LISTER,0.000000,"*Me*? What did I do?"
1,6,RIMMER,-0.333333,"You hummed. Maliciously and persistently for two years. Every time I sat down to do some revision: MMMMmmMMmMmMMMmMMMMMMMmmm--"
1,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Hang on, hang on. Are you saying you never became an officer because you shared your quarters with someone who hummed?"
1,6,RIMMER,-0.666667,"Obviously not just that, Lister. Everything! Everything you ever did was designed to hold me back and annoy me."
1,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Like what?"
1,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Like using my mother's photograph as an ashtray."
1,6,LISTER,0.000000,"I didn't know! I thought it was a souvenir from Titan Zoo."

1,6,LISTER,-0.333333,"It's not only one-way, Rimmer. You're hardly Mr. Nice Guy. Mr. Easy-To-Live-With."

1,6,LISTER,-0.666667,"I'm talking about playing your self-hypnosis tapes all through the night. "Learn Esperanto While You Sleep." "Learn Quantum Theory While You Sleep.""
1,6,RIMMER,1.000000,"We both got the same benefit."
1,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Yeah, neither of us got any sleep. And what about the time you tied me hair to the bedpost and then sounded the fire alarm?"
1,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Lister, I did that because I was sick of you annoying me. I don't have to explain it."
1,6,LISTER,0.000000,"I nearly needed brain surgery!"
1,6,RIMMER,0.333333,"What brains? The point is you've always stopped me being successful. That's a scientific fact."

1,6,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Well, I'm not, am I? I'm moving out. Out of Slob City and into Successville."
1,6,LISTER,0.000000,"What, you mean next door?"
1,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"It's not the place, Lister. It's the company. I'm about to share my life with someone who'll give me encouragement and understanding. The thrust and parry of meaningful conversation."
1,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Absolutely, Mr. Rimmer. I'll be along lickety-split."
1,6,RIMMER,-0.666667,"What a guy! I just don't know why I didn't think if this before. A duplicate me."

1,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"Yes, Arnold. And Arnold."
1,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I'm going to bed, Arnold."
1,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"But I'm getting up in a minute."
1,6,RIMMER,1.000000,"Fantastic! This is what I've always dreamed of! I'm in heaven!"
1,6,HOLLY,-0.500000,"It is four-thirty. Here is your early-morning alarm call."
1,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"That's the way. Smooth and even. Up and down."
1,6,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Ah, Lister. Bonnen Maitenon. Didn't wake you, I trust?"
1,6,LISTER,0.000000,"No, I haven't been to bed yet."
1,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"But it's five past five in the morning. It's practically lunchtime."
1,6,LISTER,0.000000,"What are you doing?"
1,6,RIMMER,-0.166667,"It's called "work," Lister. I didn't think you'd recognize it. W-O-R-K. It is in the dictionary.  Come on, paint! Paint, paint, paint!"
1,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"But why are they painting the color the same color it was before?"
1,6,RIMMER,-0.500000,"They're changing it from Ocean Gray to Military Gray. Something that should've been done a long time ago."
1,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Looks exactly the same to me."
1,6,RIMMER,-0.666667,"No. No, no, no.  That's the new Military Gray bit there, and that's the dowdy, old, nasty Ocean Gray bit there."
1,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Or is it the other way 'round?"
1,6,LISTER,0.000000,"It doesn't matter, Rimmer. It very nice. So how's Mrs. Rimmer?"
1,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Tee hee, hoddle, ha. Why don't you just get back into your cesspit or you won't have the energy for a full day's slob."
1,6,LISTER,0.000000,"I just wondered what you talked about and that, you know."
1,6,RIMMER,-0.666667,"Millions of things, Lister. Apart from being a complete genius, that man happens to be a total delight. Has me in stitches all the time."
1,6,LISTER,0.333333,"What? I mean, he knows everything you know and you know everything he knows. So what do you talk about?"
1,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"We reminisce, chew over old times, past glories, old girlfriends."
1,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Oh, you mean Yvonne MacGruder?"
1,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Don't say Yvonne MacGruder as if she's the only one."
1,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"Oh, go on, then. Name one other girlfriend, then."
1,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Lister, I'm far, far, far too much of a gentleman to stoop to that kind of shower-room mentality. All you need to know about Yvonne MacGruder is: I gave her one!"
1,6,LISTER,0.500000,"Fine, Rimmer, fine. That's very nice. Very, very nice. So, um, what's "gazpacho soup?""
1,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"What?"
1,6,LISTER,1.000000,"It's just that they were your last words and I wondered why."
1,6,RIMMER,-0.333333,"You've been watching my death video, haven't you?! That's private! It's for my enjoyment only!"
1,6,LISTER,0.000000,"It just seemed like such a strange thing to say. "Gazpacho soup.""
1,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Well, I'm sorry I didn't have time to sit down and bash out a speech in iambic pentameter. I was hit in the face by an atomic explosion."
1,6,LISTER,0.000000,"But why "gazpacho soup?""
1,6,RIMMER,1.000000,"That, Lister, is something that you will never ever know."
1,6,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Arnold, you asked me to remind you when it was time for your Esperanto revision."
1,6,RIMMER,0.500000,"Thank you, Holly.  You two, carry on."
1,6,LISTER,1.000000,""A to Z of Red Dwarf!" Ha, ha, ha-ha!"
1,6,LISTER,0.000000,"I thought so!"
1,6,LISTER,-0.142857,""My Diary, by Arnold J. Rimmer. January the first: I have decided to keep a journal of my thoughts and deeds over the coming year. A daily chart of my progress through the echelons of command, so that perhaps one day, other aspiring officers may seek enlightenment through these pages. It is my fond hope that, one day, this journal will take its place alongside `Napoleon's War Diaries' and `The Memories of Julius Caesar'." Next entry... "July the seventeenth: Auntie Maggie's Birthday." "November the twenty-fifth: Gazpacho Soup day!" That's six weeks before the crew got wiped out."

1,6,CAT,0.250000,"Did you see him clearly? Could you spot him in a parade? I don't think so. I could've been anybody."
1,6,LISTER,0.750000,"Ten and three-quarter centimeters! Plus five for not breaking and that is a big, big score! The Brown's are going to have to do something quite sensational with their last bubble. Quite clearly."
1,6,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Busy, Dave?"
1,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well, yeah, I am, actually!"
1,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"Oh. Then you won't want to know about the two super-lightspeed fighters that are tracking us."
1,6,LISTER,0.000000,"What?!"
1,6,HOLLY,-1.000000,"I'll leave you to your bubble blowing, mate."

1,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"They're from Earth."
1,6,LISTER,0.000000,"That's three million years away."
1,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"They're from the NorWEB Federation."

1,6,LISTER,-0.333333,"Me? Why? What for?"
1,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"For your crimes against humanity."
1,6,LISTER,0.000000,"You what?!"
1,6,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Seems when you left Earth, three million years ago, you left two half-eaten German sausages on a plate in your kitchen."
1,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Did I?"
1,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"You know what happens to sausages left unattended for three million years?"
1,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah, they go mouldy."
1,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"Your sausages, Dave, now cover seven-eighths of the Earth's surface. Also, you left seventeen pounds, fifty pence in your bank account. Thanks to compound interest you now own 98% of all the world's wealth. And because you hoarded it for three million years, nobody's got any money except for you and NorWEB."
1,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Why NorWEB?"
1,6,HOLLY,-0.500000,"You left a light on in the bathroom. I've got a final demand here for one hundred and eighty billion pounds."
1,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"A hundred and eighty billion pounds?!! You're kidding!"
1,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"April Fool."
1,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"But it's not April!"
1,6,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Yeah, I know. But I can't be waiting six months with a red-hot jape like that underneath me hat."
1,6,LISTER,0.000000,"So you just made it all up, then?"
1,6,HOLLY,-0.500000,"Yeah. Bit of excitement for a while, wasn't it? You can't beat a good wheeze. Huhu!"
1,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"I don't need a good wheeze. You can do your own excitement for yourself."
1,6,HOLLY,-0.666667,"No, you can't. You haven't got a clue. You're useless."
1,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Shhhhh!"
1,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"I make you vomit?"
1,6,LISTER,0.000000,"What's that?"
1,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I'm not gonna stand here and take this abuse."
1,6,RIMMER,-0.500000,"That's a lie! A lie, lie, lie, lie, lie!"

1,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Mister what?"
1,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"That is the most obscenely hurtful thing."
1,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"That is the straw that broke the dromedary, that is. You're finished, Rimmer."
1,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Ah, Lister... How are you?"
1,6,LISTER,0.000000,"I'm tickety-boo. What d'ya want?"
1,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I don't suppose you've managed to get that Blu-Tac together for me, have you?"
1,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Rimmer, it's three A.M.!"
1,6,RIMMER,-0.500000,"It doesn't matter. It can wait til the morning.  I'm just gonna sleep here, okay? So, when you're ready."
1,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Everything all right, is it?"
1,6,RIMMER,0.333333,"Sure! Absolutely. Yeah, sure."
1,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"No problems, then?"
1,6,RIMMER,-0.666667,"No! No, no. Things couldn't be hunky-dorier."
1,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"It's just I thought I heard, you know, um, raised voices?"
1,6,RIMMER,0.200000,"Heh. It's quite an amusing thought, isn't it? Having a... a blazing row with yourself."
1,6,RIMMER,-0.666667,"Obviously, we have professional disagreements. But, I mean, nothing with any side to it. Nothing malicious."
1,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Excuse me a second, Lister, will you?"
1,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"STOP YOUR FOUL WHINING, YA FILTHY PIECE OF DISTENDED RECTUM!!!"
1,6,RIMMER,-0.750000,"Lister, there's no point in concealing it anymore. Rimmer and me, we've had a bit of a tiff. Nothing major. But it goes without saying, IT WAS HIS FAULT!"
1,6,CAT,1.000000,"Shut up!"
1,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Look, will you stop doing that?"
1,6,CAT,-1.000000,"I'm trying to watch the film!"

1,6,LISTER,1.000000,"It's you, Rimmer."
1,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Wait a minute. Just wait a minute. Hold your horses. Hang on."
1,6,LISTER,-0.600000,"It's your own fault, Rimmer. If you'd've given me Kochanski's hologram, none of this would've happened. You made the bed, you lie in it. Drive Room. Ten minutes."
1,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I don't believe it. I've been ippy-dippied to death."
1,6,LISTER,0.000000,"I want you out."

1,6,LISTER,-0.333333,"Ooooh! I didn't know you had any medals! What are they?"
1,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Three Year Long Service, Six Years Long Service, Nine Years Long Service, Twelve Years Long Service."
1,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Come on, just one drink."
1,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"I'll have a whiskey."
1,6,LISTER,1.000000,"Holly, give 'em a whiskey."
1,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"How would you like it?"
1,6,RIMMER,0.500000,"Straight. With ice and lemonade, a cherry and a slice of lemon."
1,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Another?"
1,6,RIMMER,0.666667,"And another.  And another. Make it a double."
1,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"So, um, what's all this gazpacho soup business? What's it all about?"
1,6,RIMMER,-0.133333,"I suppose now I'm doomed, I can tell you. Gazpacho soup. It was the greatest night of my life. I'd been invited to the Captain's Table. I'd only been with the company fourteen years. Six officers and me! They called me "Arnold." We had gazpacho soup for starters. I didn't know gazpacho soup was meant to be served cold. I called over the chef and I told him to take it away and bring it back hot. He did! The looks on their faces still haunt me today!! I thought they were laughing at the chef, when all the time, they were laughing at me as I ate my piping hot gazpacho soup! I never ate at the Captain's Table again. That was the end of my career."
1,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"Oh, come on. Anyone could've made that mistake."
1,6,RIMMER,-0.800000,"If only they'd've mentioned it in Basic Training! Instead of climbing up and down ropes and crawling on your elbows through tunnels. If only, just once, they'd said, "Gazpacho soup is served cold!" I could've been an admiral by now!  Instead of a nothing which is what I am, let's face it."
1,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"Aw, come one. You're not a nothing."
1,6,CAT,1.000000,"He is."
1,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"You're right!"
1,6,CAT,1.000000,"I know I'm right."
1,6,RIMMER,-0.285714,"I never got off the bottom rung. And do you know why? Because I didn't have the right nobby parents. I bet Todhunter was fed gazpacho soup the moment he was on solids. No, I bet he was breast-fed with it. One side gazpacho soup and the other side freely dispensing chilled champagne! Phbbbbttttt.....!"
1,6,CAT,-0.500000,"Is this gonna go on all day? I thought he was gonna get wiped!"
1,6,RIMMER,-0.400000,"Yes, go on. Turn me off. Go on. Turn me off. Get rid of me."
1,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"I've already done it. I wiped the other one."
1,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"What?! You wiped... When??!!"
1,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Just before you came in."
1,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"And you let me stand here and bare my soul?"
1,6,LISTER,0.500000,"Yeah. You see, I wanted to find out about gazpacho soup and I knew you wouldn't tell me."
1,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Well, of course, I wouldn't tell you. You'd make my life a hell with gazpacho soup jokes for the rest of my life!"
1,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Rimmer, I promise -- I *swear* -- I will never, ever mention this conversation again. And when I swear, I mean it."
1,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"You promise?"
1,6,LISTER,1.000000,"I promise."
1,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Do you swear absolutely?"
1,6,LISTER,1.000000,"I swear absolutely that I promise that I will never mention gazpacho soup again!"
1,6,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Allright. You're a bit of a slob, Lister, you know, but, when it comes down to it, you keep your word. This time I'm gonna believe you. Let's go for another drink."
1,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Souper!"
2,1,HOLLY,0.000000,"Three million years from Earth, the mining ship Red Dwarf. Its crew: Dave Lister, the last human being alive; Arnold Rimmer, a hologram of his dead bunkmate; and a creature who evolved from the ship's cat. Message ends."

2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"I hope when you come the weather will be clement."
2,1,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Lister, don't tell me. I could've got that."
2,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Ah... I remember this from last time..."
2,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Please could you direct me to a five-star hotel?"
2,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Wrong, actually. Totally, utterly, and completely wrong."
2,1,RIMMER,1.000000,"Lister, will you please shut up?"
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"I'm only helping ya!"
2,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Well I don't need any help."
2,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I would like to purchase that orange inflatable beach ball and that small bucket and spade."
2,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"What? Pause!"
2,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"Rimmer, you've been doing Esperanto for eight years. How come you're so utterly useless?"
2,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Oh, speaks! And how many books have you read in your entire life? The same number as champion the wonder horse: zero!"
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"I've read books."
2,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Uh, Lister, we're not talking about books where the main character is a dog called "Ben.""
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"I went to Art College!"
2,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"You?"
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah!"
2,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"How did you get into Art College?"
2,1,LISTER,-0.250000,"The normal way you get into Art College. The same old, usual, normal, boring you get in. Failed me exams and applied. The snatched me up."
2,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Ah, but you didn't get a degree, did you?"
2,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"No, I dropped out. I wasn't in long."
2,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"How long?"
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"97 minutes. I thought it was going to be a good skive and all that, you know? But I took one look at the time table and just checked out, man. I mean, it was ridiculous. They had, they had lectures at, like, first thing, in the afternoon. We're talking half-past twelve everyday. Who's together by then? You can still taste the toothpaste."
2,1,RIMMER,-0.800000,"Well, unlike you, Lister, I have ambitions. I'm not prepared to sit around all day polishing my space-bike so I can go joyriding through some asteroid belt. 'Cause I'm not a gimp! And one of my ambitions is to learn another language so kindly let me get on with it. Play."
2,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Ah, now this is one I do know."
2,1,HOLLY,-1.000000,"The menu looks interesting -- I think I'll try the chicken."
2,1,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Holly, as the Esperantinos would say, "Bonvolu alsendi la pordiston? Lausajne estas rano en mia bideo!" And I think we all know what that means."
2,1,HOLLY,-0.500000,"Yeah, it means, "Could you send for the hall porter? There appears to be a frog in my bidet.""
2,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Is it? Well what's that one about, "Your father was a baboon's rump and your mother spent most of her life up against walls with sailors?""
2,1,HOLLY,-1.000000,"I'm not telling you."
2,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"It's because you're bored, isn't it? That's why you're both annoying me."
2,1,HOLLY,-0.666667,"I'm not bored. I've had a really busy morning. I've devised a system to totally revolutionize music."
2,1,LISTER,1.000000,"Get out of town!"
2,1,HOLLY,-0.333333,"Yeah, I've decimalized it. Instead of the octave, it's the decatave. And I've invented two new notes: H and J."
2,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Hang on a minute, you can't just invent new notes."
2,1,HOLLY,-0.666667,"Well I have. Now it goes:  Do Re Mi Fa So La Wo Bo Ti Do. Do Ti Bo Wo La So Fa Mi Re Do."
2,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"What are you drivelling about?"
2,1,HOLLY,0.000000,"Holrock. It'll be a whole new sound. All the instruments will be extra big to incorporate my two new notes. Triangles will have four sides. Piano keyboards the length of zebra crossings. Course, women will have to be banned from playing the cello."
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Holly, shut up."
2,1,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Oh, I forgot, I haven't told you the news."
2,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"What news?"
2,1,HOLLY,-0.666667,"A signal. We're getting a signal. It's probably nothing but I just thought I'd mention it."
2,1,RIMMER,1.000000,"Aliens!"
2,1,LISTER,-0.200000,"Oh god, aliens? Your explanation for anything slightly peculiar is aliens, isn't it? You lose your keys -- it's aliens. A picture falls off the wall -- it's aliens. That time we used up a whole bog roll in a day -- you thought that was aliens as well."
2,1,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Well we didn't use it all, Lister. Who did?"
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Rimmer, aliens used our bog roll?"
2,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Just 'cause they're aliens doesn't mean to say the don't have to visit the little boys' room. Only they probably do something weird and alienesque like it comes out of the top of their heads or something."
2,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well I wouldn't like to be stuck behind one in a cinema."
2,1,CAT,-0.333333,"Here, mousie, mousie! I've got some cheese! I only want to be your friend!"
2,1,LISTER,-0.333333,"Yo, Cat!  We're getting a signal. Come on."
2,1,RIMMER,1.000000,"Aliens!"
2,1,HOLLY,-0.333333,"It's a distress call from a ship called the Nova-5. They've crash-landed. I'm trying to establish contact."
2,1,LISTER,0.500000,"Another ship! Brilliant!"
2,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"So it's not aliens, then?"
2,1,HOLLY,0.000000,"No, they're from Earth. I hope they'd got some spare odds and sods on board. We're a bit short on a few supplies."
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Like what?"
2,1,HOLLY,0.000000,"Cow's milk. Ran out of that yonks ago. Fresh and dehydrated."
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"What kind of milk are we using now?"
2,1,HOLLY,0.000000,"Emergency back-up supply. We're on the dog's milk."
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Dog's milk?!"
2,1,HOLLY,0.000000,"Nothing wrong with dog's milk. Full of goodness, full of vitamins, full of marrowbone jelly. Lasts longer than any other type of milk, dog's milk."
2,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Why?"
2,1,HOLLY,-0.500000,"No bugger'll drink it. Plus the advantage of dog's milk is when it goes off it takes exactly the same as when it's fresh."
2,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Why didn't you tell me, Holly?!"
2,1,HOLLY,0.000000,"What, and spoil your tea?"
2,1,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Hang about, we've got contact."
2,1,RIMMER,1.000000,"Punch it up."
2,1,KRYTEN,-0.285714,"Thank goodness! My name is Kryten. I'm the service mechanoid aboard the Nova-5. We've had a terrible accident. The male officers died on impact. The female officers are injured but stable. Please help us."
2,1,CAT,0.000000,"Is that female as in "soft and squidgy?""
2,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"How many?"
2,1,KRYTEN,0.333333,"Three. Miss Jane, Miss Tracy, and Miss Anne. I am transmitting medical details."
2,1,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Tell them we're coming aboard. By god, we'll rescue these fair blooms or my name's not, "Captain A.J. Rimmer, Space Adventurer.""
2,1,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Thank you, Captain."
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,""Space Adventurer?""
2,1,RIMMER,-0.250000,"What was I supposed to say? "Fear not, I'm the bloke you used to clean the gunk out the chicken soup machine! Actually, we know sod all about space travel but if you've got a blocked nozzle, we're your lads!?" That'll fill them with confidence, won't it?"
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"How far are we away, Hol?"
2,1,HOLLY,-1.000000,"'bout 24 hours."
2,1,CAT,-0.285714,"What?! Only 24 hours?! I better start getting ready. Twenty-four hours... Ahhh!!! First in the shower room! Heh heh heh!  Hey, I'm so excited all six of my nipples are tingling!"
2,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"What's the matter with him? We're on a mission of mercy. We're taking them urgently needed medical supplies. We're not on the pull!"
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"God!"
2,1,RIMMER,-0.800000,"No, we're not "on the pull," are we, Lister? Look at you. You're absolutely pathetic. You're really trying, aren't you? You're wearing all your least smeggy things."
2,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"I don't know what you're talking about."
2,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"That t-shirt with only two curry stains on the front of it. You only wear that on special occasions. You're toffed up to the nines, laddy!"
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"And what about you? You look like Clive of India! Or the one whose mum does use new biological biz!"
2,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Oh! It's started. I knew it would."
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"What has?"
2,1,RIMMER,0.333333,"The put-downs. It's always the same when we meet girls. Put me down and make yourself look good."
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Like when?"
2,1,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Remember those two little brunettes from supplies? And I told them I worked in stores and they were really interested and asked me exactly what I did there."
2,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"And I said you were a shelf."
2,1,RIMMER,-0.666667,"Exactly! And I suggested a little trip to Titan Zoo and you said, "Eww! He's taking ya home ta meet his mum already!""
2,1,LISTER,1.000000,"So? They laughed!"
2,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Yes, at me! At my expense! Just don't put me down when we meet them."
2,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"Okay, whatcha want me to say? How do you want me to act?"
2,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"I don't know. Just act with respect. For a start, don't call me "Rimmer.""
2,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Why not?"
2,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Because you always put the emphasis on "Rim" in "Rimmer." Makes me sound like a lavatory disinfectant."
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Well what do you want me to call you? "Rim-MER?""
2,1,RIMMER,-0.333333,"I don't know. Um, "Arnie," "Arn," uh, something with a little more... I don't know. How about "Big Man?""
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,""Big Man?""
2,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Or what about the nickname I had a school?"
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"What? "Bonehead?""
2,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"How did you know my nickname was "Bonehead?""
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"I was only guessing."
2,1,RIMMER,-0.500000,"I didn't mean that. I meant the other one."
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"What other one?"
2,1,RIMMER,0.000000,""Ace!""
2,1,LISTER,0.333333,"Get out of town! Your nickname was never "Ace!" Maybe "Ace- hole.""
2,1,RIMMER,-0.500000,"It was my nickname at school, actually. It's just, no one ever called me it despite the many times I let them beat me up."
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"What are you trying to say to me, Rimmer?"
2,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I'm trying to say build me up, don't put me down."
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Like?"
2,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Like, if the opportunity occurs and it crops up naturally in conversation, you could perhaps mention that I'm very brave."
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Do what?"
2,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Don't go ape. Just sort of mention, perhaps, that I died and I was pretty, incredibly brave about it. Well, I mean, you know, you could mention hints that I've had tons of girlfriends."
2,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"All right, forget it, it was just an idea. Oh, you're not wearing those boots, are you?"
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"What's wrong with them?"
2,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Oh, they just don't go, not with that lot. Uh, you should wear your Day-Glo orange moon boots."
2,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"You said they were disgusting."
2,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Ew, no, very chic."
2,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"You said they smelled like an orangutan's posing pouch and set off one of those dangerous chemical alarms. You made me put them in the air-lock."
2,1,RIMMER,-0.250000,"No, no. That was a mistake. They really look terrific on you. I'd wear them."
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Honest?"
2,1,RIMMER,1.000000,"Definitely."
2,1,KRYTEN,0.250000,"Come along, everybody! They're here! They're in orbit! Miss Jane!"
2,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"What a mess you look!  Smart but casual."
2,1,KRYTEN,-0.666667,"Miss Anne! Why, you haven't touched your soup! No wonder you're beginning to look so pasty."
2,1,KRYTEN,0.333333,"Oh, do eat nicely, Miss Anne! What on Earth will the visitors think if they see you eating like that? Hmm?"
2,1,KRYTEN,0.500000,"Ah, Miss Tracy.  No, you look absolutely perfect."
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"What's that smell?"
2,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I can't smell anything."
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Are you okay? Your eyes are watering."
2,1,RIMMER,0.333333,"It's the excitement. Look, we can't wait for the cat. Let's just go."
2,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"Oh, come on, he's been preparing for a day and a night. Don't you want to see the result?"
2,1,CAT,0.000000,"Aaaaaoooowww! Wait for me!"
2,1,CAT,0.000000,"Aaaaoow! Hi, monkeys! Meet a plastic surgeon's nightmare!"
2,1,RIMMER,1.000000,"A spacesuit with cufflinks."
2,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Where'd ya get the helmet?"
2,1,CAT,-0.400000,"I made it myself. I didn't want to muss up my hair. Hey, listen, we just gotta make sure we don't pass any mirrors, 'cause if we do, I'm there for the day.  Ewww! What's that smell?"
2,1,HOLLY,0.000000,"All right, everybody ready? Let's go, then."
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"What are you doing, Hol?"
2,1,HOLLY,-0.500000,"What? What's wrong?"
2,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"The rug, man. Why are you wearing a toupee?"
2,1,HOLLY,0.000000,"What toupee?"
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"The one on your head."
2,1,HOLLY,0.000000,"Who's head's that, then?"
2,1,LISTER,0.500000,"Your head. It makes you look like a game show host."
2,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"What's wrong with everyone? Three million years without a woman and you all act as if you're fourteen years old."
2,1,HOLLY,0.500000,"Oh, yeah? What about you and the socks?"
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"What socks?"
2,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Come on, we can't hang about."
2,1,HOLLY,1.000000,"He ordered two pairs of socks."
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"What for?"
2,1,HOLLY,-1.000000,"One pair to put on his feet and the other pair to roll up and put down his trousers."
2,1,KRYTEN,0.500000,"Come in, come in. How lovely to meet you!"
2,1,RIMMER,0.666667,"Er, carmita. And what a delightful craft you have. Reminds me of my first command."
2,1,KRYTEN,1.000000,"This way, please."
2,1,CAT,1.000000,"Hey, you're a work of art, baby!"
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Psst!"
2,1,CAT,0.000000,"Uh, you're going to have to help me, man."
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Come on."
2,1,CAT,1.000000,"Thank you!"
2,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I'm so excited. We all are! The girls could scarcely stop themselves from jumping up and down."
2,1,RIMMER,0.500000,"Ah ha ha. Carmita, carmita!"
2,1,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Ah! Vi parolas Espekanton, Kapitano Rimmer?"
2,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Uh, come again?"
2,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"You speak Esperanto, Captain Rimmer?"
2,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Oh, si, si, si, jawohl, oiu!"
2,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Well, here they are."
2,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Carmita..."
2,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well... it's a bit difficult to know what to say. Isn't it, Ace?"
2,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well, isn't anybody going to say, "Hello?""
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"I think the blonde one's giving you the eye."
2,1,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Well, I'll leave you to get acquainted. I'll just go and fix some tea."
2,1,CAT,1.000000,"Hi, baby!"
2,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I don't believe this."
2,1,LISTER,1.000000,"Be strong, Big Man!"
2,1,RIMMER,1.000000,"Our first contact with intelligent life in three million and two years and it's the android version of Norman Bates."
2,1,CAT,-0.500000,"Come on, guys. So they're a little on the skinny side."
2,1,LISTER,0.500000,"Listen, girls. I don't know whether this is the time or place to say this but my mate, Ace, here is incredibly, 'credibly brave!"
2,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Smeg off, dog food face!"
2,1,LISTER,1.000000,"And he's got just tons and tons of girlfriends!"
2,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I'm warning you, Lister!"
2,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Well, is anything the matter?"
2,1,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Anything the matter? They're dead."
2,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Who's dead?"
2,1,RIMMER,-0.500000,"They are dead. They're all dead."
2,1,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"My god! Well, I was only away two minutes!"
2,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"They've been dead for centuries!"
2,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"No!"
2,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Yes!"
2,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Are you a doctor?"
2,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"You've only got to look at them. They've got less meat on them than a Chicken McNugget!"
2,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Well, what am I going to do? I'm, I'm, I'm programmed to serve them."
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"I think the first thing we should do is bury them."
2,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"You're that sure they're dead?"
2,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Yes!!"
2,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"What about this one?"
2,1,RIMMER,1.000000,"There's a simple test.  All right, girls, hands up, those of you who are alive."
2,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well, what am I going to do??"
2,1,KRYTEN,0.333333,"But I can't leave them! Mister David, please! Take me back!"
2,1,LISTER,1.000000,"Aw, Kryten, you've got to start a new life now."
2,1,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"I haven't got the software to cope with this. I was created to serve. I serve, therefore I am. That is my purpose -- to serve and have no regard for myself."
2,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"You're beginning to sound like my mum."
2,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"It's all I know."
2,1,LISTER,-0.333333,"You've got to change, haven't ya? You gotta work out what you want. Stop being everyone's smeggin' doormat."
2,1,KRYTEN,0.500000,"That's easy for you to say, Mister David. You're a human."
2,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Only just."
2,1,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Ah, Kryten. Nothing to do, eh? Follow me."
2,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"What the smeggin' hell is going on?"
2,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Good afternoon, Mister David, sir."
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"What are these?"
2,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Your boxer shorts, Mister David, sir."
2,1,LISTER,-0.333333,"No way are these my boxer shorts. These bend! What have you done to the place?"
2,1,KRYTEN,1.000000,"I've done a spot of tidying up."
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"But where is everything? Where's me coffee cup with the mould in it?"
2,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I threw it away, sir."
2,1,LISTER,-0.666667,"But I was breeding that mould. His name was "Albert." I was trying to get him two foot high."
2,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Why, sir?"
2,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Because it drives Rimmer nuts and driving Rimmer nuts is what keeps me going."
2,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I'm sorry, Mister David, sir."
2,1,LISTER,-0.333333,"Look at ya. What are you doing? Why are you doing all this?"
2,1,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Well, serving makes me happy, sir."
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"But what about you? Don't you ever want to do anything just for yourself?"
2,1,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Myself?  Well, that's a bit of a barmy notion, if you don't mind my saying so, sir."
2,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Come on, there must be something you look forward to."
2,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,""Androids." "Androids... everybody needs good androids...""
2,1,LISTER,-1.500000,"That stupid soap opera? Why?"
2,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well, because, for half an hour a week, I can forget I'm me."
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,""Androids?" What else?"
2,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Oh, ah, being asleep."
2,1,LISTER,-0.500000,""Androids" and being asleep?  Sounds like a crazy, fun-packed life you lead there, Kryten, me old son."
2,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I have strange thoughts when I'm asleep."
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah, they're called dreams."
2,1,KRYTEN,-0.666667,"My favorite one is that I'm, I'm in a garden. I've never even seen a garden except in books.  And I've planted everything and made it grow. It's my garden. And there's no one there except me, just me and all the things I've made live.  Silly."
2,1,LISTER,0.500000,"No, it isn't! Find a planet with an atmosphere and do it."
2,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I can't. I'm programmed to serve."
2,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"There's no one to serve, Kryten. That's the point."
2,1,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"What about Mister Arnold?  I've got to complete Mister Arnold's tasks."
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"You what?! Rimmer gave you all this?"
2,1,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Well, Mister Arnold is my master now."
2,1,LISTER,-0.400000,""Mister Arnold" isn't his name. His name's "Rimmer." Or "Smeghead." Or "Dinosaur Breath" or "Molecule Mind." And on a really special occasion when you want to be really mega-polite to him, Kryten, we're talking MEGA-polite, in those exceptional circumstances, you can call him "Arse-hole.""
2,1,CAT,1.000000,"Yeah, yeah, yeah!"
2,1,RIMMER,1.000000,"I think it will be best on that wall, sort of dominating the room."
2,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Yes, Mister Arnold, sir."
2,1,LISTER,-1.000000,""Yes, Mister Arnold, sir." You're a total Gwendolyn, do you know that, Kryten?"
2,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Oh, yes, Mister David, sir."
2,1,LISTER,-1.000000,""Yes, Mister David, sir.""
2,1,RIMMER,0.333333,"Leave it alone, Lister. It enjoys doing the task I give. It makes it happy."
2,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Drop dead, Rimmer."
2,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Already have done."
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Encore!"
2,1,CAT,-0.500000,"You'd never get a cat to be a servant. You ever see a cat return a stick?  Hey, man! You threw the stick, you go get it, yourself! I'm busy! If you wanted the stick so bad, why'd you throw it away in the first place?"
2,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Kryten, you never got a thing from those movies I showed you, did ya?"
2,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"What movies?"
2,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Mister David was kind enough to take me to see "The Wild Ones," "Easy Rider," and "Rebel Without a Cause.""
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,"I thought it might do him some good. Fat chance! In the middle of Marlon Brando's rebel speech, he gets out a brush-a-matic and starts doing me lapels!"
2,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Well, now, maybe you'll learn, Lister. There's a natural order to things in life. Some give orders, others obey. That's the way it's always been, that's the way it's always going to be. Isn't that true, Kryten?"
2,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Oh, yes, Mister Arnold, sir."
2,1,LISTER,0.000000,""Yes, Mister Arnold..." What's the point?"
2,1,KRYTEN,0.500000,"Ah. I've finished, Mister Arnold, sir."
2,1,RIMMER,2.000000,"Excellent, Kryten!"
2,1,KRYTEN,0.500000,"I think it's rather good. Don't you, Mister Arnold, sir?"
2,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"What are you doing?"
2,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I, um, I think I'm, uh, rebelling."
2,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Rebelling?!"
2,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Yes, I, uh, I, I, I, I think that's what I'm doing."
2,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"You are rebelling?"
2,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Mmmm... yes."
2,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"What are you rebelling against?"
2,1,KRYTEN,0.200000,"Whaddya got?  Dinosaur Breath! Molecule Mind!  Smeg-for-brains!  I need your bike."
2,1,LISTER,1.000000,"You got it!"
2,1,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Swivel on it, punk!"
2,2,HOLLY,0.000000,"Three million years from Earth, the mining ship Red Dwarf. Its crew: Dave Lister, the last human being alive; Arnold Rimmer, a hologram of his dead bunkmate; and a creature who evolved from the ship's cat. Message ends."
2,2,LISTER,-0.500000,""For a mild stomach upset take one teaspoonful. For acute indigestion take two.""
2,2,RIMMER,0.500000,"Well, a highly enjoyable meal all round. Obviously you can't expect perfection first time but I was quite delighted with the way my dumplings went down."
2,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Rimmer, real dumplings, proper dumplings when they're properly cooked to perfection, proper dumplings, should not bounce."
2,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"True, but compared to what I thought they were going to be like they were quite superb."
2,2,LISTER,0.000000,"So how's the Cat?"
2,2,RIMMER,-0.333333,"He's just sleeping off the stomach pump. He'll be alright. The lamb was a bit of a flop though."
2,2,LISTER,0.000000,"The lamb? Everybody thought the lamb was the cheese and that lemon meringue pie, man, what was in that?"
2,2,RIMMER,1.000000,"I thought you liked that, you brought some back."
2,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Yeah, I wanted to try some on my athlete's foot."
2,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"It's not easy, Lister, cooking. When you're dead, when you don't exist, when you're made entirely of light."
2,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"That's your excuse for everything isn't it -- being dead?"
2,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I'm just trying to rehabilitate myself, trying to do the everyday, normal things that most living people take for granted."
2,2,LISTER,1.000000,"You've got the skutters to help you."
2,2,RIMMER,-0.500000,"What? Pinky and smeggy Perky? What use are they? It's like giving Blind Pew contact lenses."
2,2,LISTER,0.000000,"They only do what you tell them to."
2,2,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Ah, but they don't do they? You say, "Keep an eye on that lamb," and they do. They sit there for three hours and watch it burn."
2,2,LISTER,-0.666667,"So. They've got no emotion have they? It's not built into their software."
2,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Have you seen their broom cupboard? it's full of pin-ups of John Wayne. That cannot be right can it?  Piled this high with Film Fun magazines. It's not the way spanners behave in my book."
2,2,HOLLY,0.000000,"Oi. What's happening dudes?"
2,2,LISTER,1.000000,"Hi, Hol."
2,2,HOLLY,0.000000,"Guess what?"
2,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"What?"
2,2,HOLLY,0.000000,"Go on, have a guess."
2,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"What is it vaguely about?"
2,2,HOLLY,-1.000000,"No clues, just have a guess."
2,2,HOLLY,-0.500000,"I knew you wouldn't get it. Post pod's arrived."
2,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"What, the mail?"
2,2,HOLLY,0.000000,"It's been tracking us since we left Earth. Now we've turned round it's caught up."
2,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Do you mean it's taken 3 million years."
2,2,HOLLY,0.000000,"Yeah, that's about average for second class post."
2,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"See what I mean?"
2,2,RIMMER,1.000000,"There's everything here, all the mail, entertainment cassettes, a new batch of movies."
2,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"Oh! The new Friday the 13th movie -- Friday the 13th part one thousand six hundred and forty nine."
2,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Look, Cassablanca! They've re-made Cassablanca!"
2,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Philistines. I mean how can you re-make Cassablanca? The one starring Myra Dinglebat and Peter Beardsley was definitive."
2,2,HOLLY,0.500000,"I saw that one -- knockout! "Of all the space bars on all the worlds you had to re-materialise in mine.""
2,2,RIMMER,1.000000,"Look, a cassette of a whole year of Earth news here."
2,2,LISTER,0.000000,"And two seasons of zero gee football. I'll see you in the spring."
2,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Ah ah ah ah. What are total immersion video games?"
2,2,LISTER,-0.200000,"Where? Oh these are brilliant.  You can't get hold of these for love nor money! These are like Venus's arms. These are like Brooke Shield's buttocks."
2,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"What are they?"
2,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"Well they're computer games aren't they? But electrodes are inserted into your frontal lobes and hypothalamus right? So you actually feel as though you're really, really there. Yessssss."
2,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Fine. Holly there's something here for you. It's a video letter."
2,2,HOLLY,0.000000,"Bung it on."
2,2,HOLLY,1.000000,"Strike a light, it's Gordon."
2,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Who's Gordon?"
2,2,HOLLY,0.000000,"He's the eleventh generation AI computer aboard the Scott Fitzgerald. He's got an IQ of eight thousand."
2,2,HOLLY,1.000000,"Awesome, his intellect, I'll tell you."
2,2,LISTER,0.000000,"You were playing postal chess with him were you?"
2,2,HOLLY,0.250000,"Well. A chance to lock horns with an intellect of that calibre I'd be a fool not to. Pawn to King four eh? He's a sly one."
2,2,LISTER,0.000000,"So who's winning Hol?"
2,2,HOLLY,0.000000,"Well, he is really. That was the first move."

2,2,RIMMER,-0.666667,"Eight thousand five hundred?  That's a lot of tax isn't it, Lister? How on Titan are you going to pay for that, eh?"
2,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"I'm not.  It's yours."
2,2,RIMMER,-0.600000,"What?  No. This is wrong. It's wrong. This is well wrong, Lister."
2,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Relax. It doesn't matter now. They're not going to catch you now are they?"
2,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"What do you mean? Just because we're three million years into deep space and the human species is extinct. That means nothing to these people. They'll find us."
2,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Me."
2,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"God, I'll be worrying about this all the time now."
2,2,LISTER,-0.666667,"Me. No another one for you. Rear Admiral Lieutenant General Rimmer."
2,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"That's from my mother."
2,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Rear Admiral?"
2,2,RIMMER,-0.666667,"Every time I take an exam I tell her I passed. It's getting embarrassing now. I should be Commander in Chief of the whole universe."
2,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Do you want me to open it?  "Dear Rimmer." Is this from your mum?"
2,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"That's mumsie!"
2,2,LISTER,-0.333333,"This handwriting's terrible. "I hope this epistle finds you adequately healthy to discharge your duties." You know maybe I shouldn't be reading this deeply personal stuff."

2,2,LISTER,0.600000,""I write to--" I can't read that. Oh, "I write to inform." "I write to inform you that your father is dad." Well of course he is. Maybe it's your father stroke dad."

2,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"I can't make it out."
2,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"My father is dead."
2,2,LISTER,0.000000,"What?"
2,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"My father is dead."
2,2,LISTER,-0.333333,"Oh yeah it's an E.  That's what it is. Your father's dead, Rimmer.  Oh, eh -- I'm sorry."
2,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Is that all she says?"
2,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Just that, "He passed away peacefully in his Jeep." "...sleep.""

2,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"No, me neither."
2,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Hmmm."
2,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"I remember when my dad died you know. I was only six. I got loads of presents off everyone like it was Christmas. I remember wishing a couple more people would die so I could complete my Lego set. My grandma tried to explain, you know. She said he'd gone away and he wasn't coming back. So, I wanted to know where, like, you know. She said he was very happy and he'd gone to the same place as my goldfish. So I thought they'd flushed him down the bog. I thought he was just round the U bend, you know. I used to stuff food down, you know, and magazines and that for him to read. They took me to a child psychologist in the end because they found me with my head down the bowl reading him the football results."
2,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I knew he was dead. I mean they're all dead, aren't they? Just getting that letter makes it seem like it happened yesterday."
2,2,LISTER,0.000000,"You never said much about him."

2,2,LISTER,0.000000,"You must have been pretty close."
2,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Close."
2,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Was it very close?"
2,2,RIMMER,-0.666667,"Close.  I hated him. I detested his fat stupid guts, the pop-eyed, balding git."
2,2,LISTER,0.000000,"What?"
2,2,RIMMER,-0.285714,"He always wanted to join the Space Corps -- be an officer. But they wouldn't take him because he was an inch below regulation height. One inch. I had three brothers. When we were young he bought a traction machine so that he could stretch us. By the time my brother Frank was eleven he was six foot five. Every morning he'd measure us and if we hadn't grown, back on the rack."
2,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Sounds like he had a screw loose."
2,2,RIMMER,-0.750000,"I don't think he had one screw fully tightened, to be perfectly honest with you. He had this fixation that we all had to get into the Space Corps. At meal times he'd ask us questions on astronavigation. If we got them wrong -- no food."
2,2,LISTER,0.000000,"God, Rimmer, how did you cope with that?"
2,2,RIMMER,-0.500000,"I didn't. I nearly died of malnutrition."
2,2,LISTER,0.000000,"I had no idea. I thought you adored your parents."
2,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"When I was fourteen I divorced them."
2,2,LISTER,0.000000,"What?"
2,2,RIMMER,-0.500000,"I took them to court. I got paid maintenance until employment age and access every fourth weekend to the family dog."
2,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"So why are you so completely blown away about him dying then?"
2,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Oh, it doesn't mean to say I don't respect him, didn't look up to him. It was only natural -- he was my father."
2,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"There's nothing natural about your family, Rimmer."
2,2,RIMMER,1.000000,"It's just I always wanted just once, just once, for him to say to me, "well done.""
2,2,LISTER,0.000000,"For what?"
2,2,RIMMER,0.666667,"For something, for anything. I wanted him to be proud of me, just once. And now ..."
2,2,CAT,-0.250000,"Wow!!! My stomach has been pumped and now I'm hungry. Hey, there you are! Hey man, I'm so hungry, I just have to eat."
2,2,LISTER,-0.333333,"Shhhhh. Not now, man. Rimmer's dad's died."
2,2,CAT,0.000000,"I'd prefer chicken."
2,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Pause."
2,2,CAT,-0.500000,"About your father. If it's any help, he's in the ground now. Sure it's bad news for him. But on the other hand it's party time for all the little worms."
2,2,CAT,-1.000000,"There's just no consoling him."
2,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"Rimmer, listen -- me and the Cat were going to play a T-I-V. We wondered if you wanted to come?"
2,2,LISTER,0.500000,"Oh, come on! Holly says he can key you in."

2,2,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Excuse me. You're probably really busy but could I just say you are my all time favourite fascist dictator and I've read all your war diaries and I thought your Italian campaign was simply brilliant. Err, could you just sign this for me. Err, make it out to my good pal Arnie from your dear chum Napolean Bonaparte. It's not for me, it's for my sister Alison. Errm, we call her Arnie."

2,2,RIMMER,1.000000,"Excellent."
2,2,CAT,-1.000000,"I'm going to eat you little fishy. I'm going to eat you little fishy cos I like little fish."
2,2,RIMMER,0.200000,"Ah, I'm sorry, I don't know what happened. I was driving along and suddenly there was McGruder. Well one thing led to another and... Good God! This is a great game! Twice in one lifetime, I'm turning into Hugh Heffner!"
2,2,LISTER,1.000000,"Rimmer, you can touch things!"
2,2,RIMMER,-0.500000,"I know. Why do you think I was so late?"
2,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Have you checked into your room yet?"
2,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"What room?"
2,2,LISTER,0.000000,"I mean, mine is absolutely brilliant. I've got this vibrating, leopard skin waterbed in the shape of a guitar."
2,2,CAT,0.000000,"Yeah? Well you should take a look at my wardrobe. It's so big it crosses an international time zone. When it's three o' clock where my shirts are it's seven in the morning for my socks."
2,2,LISTER,0.000000,"But what about my electonic lavvy? I mean this thing comes when you call it, take your trousers down, does everything for you. It's just so stylish."
2,2,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Who is that? Just because some hoity-toity, gonad brain gimp knows an Admiral, does he have to broadcast it?"
2,2,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Awwwww, yawn-o-rama city. We know an Admiral. Come on."
2,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Errr, I think there must be some mistake. I'm not an Admiral."

2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"To Rimmer!"
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"To me!"
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Are you sure you're alright to drive this?"
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah.  Oops!"
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"What time is it?"
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Saturday."
2,3,LISTER,1.000000,"Is that the best you can do?"
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"There are some numbers next to it, but they could be anything."
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Do you know what I fancy right now?"
2,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"A big, fat woman with thighs the size of a hippo's."
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"No, I want a triple fried egg butty with chili sauce and chutney."
2,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Me too."
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Well no problem then. Nothing's too good for the deathday boy."
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Correct!"
2,3,LISTER,1.000000,"Hol, Hol!"
2,3,LISTER,1.000000,"Hol, give us something to eat."
2,3,HOLLY,0.000000,"You what? I'm jiggered man."
2,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"Oh come on. You don't sleep."
2,3,HOLLY,0.500000,"Course I do. I've got to offline. I can't keep up my full tilt, full power, red hot, maximum pace all the time. I've got to take the odd breather, haven't I?"
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"I want a triple fried egg sandwich with ..."
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"With chili sauce and chutney."
2,3,HOLLY,0.000000,"You what?"
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"It's a state of the art sarny."
2,3,HOLLY,0.000000,"It's the state of the floor I'm worried about. Alright, OK."
2,3,LISTER,1.000000,"Wow, trust me!"
2,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I feel like I'm having a baby!"
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"It's good innit?"
2,3,RIMMER,0.500000,"It's incredible. Where did you get the recipe from?"
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"I can't remember. I think it was a book on bacteriological warfare."
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"It's like a cross between food and bowel surgery."
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"It's well naughty. The trouble is you've got to eat it before the bread dissolves."
2,3,RIMMER,-0.142857,"I could never invent a sandwich like this, Lister. You see all the ingredients are wrong. The fried eggs: wrong; the chutney: wrong. The chili sauce: all wrong. But put them together and somehow it works. It becomes right. It's you -- this sandwich, Lister, is you."
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"What are you saying to me, Rimmer?"
2,3,RIMMER,-0.272727,"You're wrong, right? All your ingredients are wrong. You're slobby, you've got no sense of discipline, you're the only man ever to get his money back from the Odour Eater people, but people like you, don't you see? That's why you're a fried egg, chili, chutney sandwich. Now me ... now me ... All the ingredients are right. I'm disciplined, I'm organised, I'm dedicated to my career, I've always got a pen. Result? Total smeghead despised by everyone except the ship's parrot. And that's only because we haven't got one. Why? Why is that?"
2,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"I suppose it's because you ARE a total smeghead."
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"But I'm not! I'm a nice guy -- I'm a goodie."
2,3,LISTER,-0.333333,"No, Rimmer, see the trouble is you've never got time for people. You're too busy trying to be successful. It's all midnight revision and up, up, up the ziggurat lickety spit."
2,3,RIMMER,-0.600000,"I have got time for people. What about all the time I spent licking up to Todhunter even though he was a total gimp? And Captain Hollister? Mr fat bastard 2044. I went out of my way to simp around him."
2,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Rimmer, that's not having time for people."
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Do you know how many times in my entire life I made love?"
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"No, and I don't want to know."
2,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"I want to tell you."
2,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"I don't want to know."
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"No, but I want to tell you."
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"No, I don't want to know."
2,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"I want to tell you. I'm going... I am going to tell you. I want to tell you."
2,3,LISTER,-0.200000,"Listen! Listen, Rimmer. If you tell me, right, you'll wake up in the morning. You'll have your hang over and you'll feel like death and you'll walk up to the mirror and you'll look in the mirror and you'll remember and you'll go, "Ahahahahah!!" See it's not worth it, I don't want to know and believe me you don't want to tell me."
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Once."
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Smeg!"
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"One time only."
2,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"Don't tell me this, Rimmer. You'll want to kill yourself in the morning."
2,3,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Yvonne McGruder. A single, brief liason with the ship's female boxing champion. March the sixteenth, seven thirty one PM to seven forty three PM."
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Please."
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Twelve minutes."
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Please!"
2,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"And that includes the time it took to eat the pizza."
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Please, Rimmer!"
2,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"In my entire life I have spent more time being sick."
2,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"So, I mean, you haven't met the right girl yet."
2,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"No, I haven't, Lister. I haven't met the right girl and some just might say, given the fact that the human race no longer exists, coupled with the fact that I have passed on, some just might say that I'm leaving it a little bit on the late side."
2,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well you made a decision, didn't you? I mean you chose your career over your personal life."
2,3,RIMMER,0.250000,"Yes, I did. I did, didn't I? Pearls of wisdom there from Mr fried egg, chili, chutney, sandwich face.  Well, I'll tell you something, Lister. I'll tell you something. I'd trade it all in -- all of it. My pips, my long-service medals, my swimming certificates, my telescope, my shoe trees. I'd trade everything in to be loved and to have been loved."
2,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I'm a little lamb, lost in the wood, maybe I could, really be good, with someone to watch over me."
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"That was going to be our song. But I never found anyone to share it with. So now it's just MY song."
2,3,LISTER,1.000000,"Another bit of sky, that's a star."
2,3,LISTER,-0.333333,"Ah, me foot! I must have gone to sleep on it! Oooh!"
2,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Gah! you were really putting it away last night, Lister. You really fell for my joke, didn't you?"
2,3,LISTER,1.000000,"Oh god, it's agony!"
2,3,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Ah, that McGruder gag -- fancy falling for that, eh?  I'll give you my telescope, anything. Please god, don't tell anyone."
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Have you done that?"
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"When did you do that?"
2,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"I didn't! I just went to bed and I've woken up with this."
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"When did you finish the jigsaw?"
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"I didn't."
2,3,HOLLY,-0.666667,"Oi. Whose been messing with my star charts! Here I am trying to do the comprehensive, nay, definitive A-Z of the entire universe with street names, post offices, and little steeples and everything and some git's been fiddling with it."
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"It's not us!"
2,3,CAT,0.000000,"OK, which one of you chimpanzees did this?"
2,3,HOLLY,0.000000,"Look there's a perfectly logical explanation for everything. With the possible exception of little Jimmy Osmond."
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Who?"
2,3,LISTER,1.000000,"Hang on, today's Sunday, right?"
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"So?"
2,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well, this clock; this clock says, "Thursday," and that clock says, "Thursday.""
2,3,CAT,-1.000000,"And my foot says, "Get the person who did this to my foot.""
2,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Four pages have been torn out of my diary."
2,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Somehow we've lost the last four days."
2,3,CAT,0.000000,"Did you look behind the fridge? If you lose something it's nearly always there."
2,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"Aliens!"
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"What?"
2,3,CAT,-1.000000,"What are you talking about, grease stain?"
2,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"It's a well documented phenomenon. They kidnap you, give you a mind probe, erase your memory, and put you back."
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"OK, aliens came aboard."
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Without question."
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"They broke my leg."
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"For some reason."
2,3,CAT,0.000000,"They broke MY leg."
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Right."
2,3,HOLLY,0.000000,"And then they did a jigsaw."
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Right."
2,3,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Well, that's cleared that up then."
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Look, you're not thinking alien. That's what aliens are: alien. They do alien things. Things that are... alien. Maybe this is the way they communicate."
2,3,CAT,0.000000,"By breaking legs?"
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"And doing jigsaws?"
2,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Why should they speak the way we do? They're aliens."
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"OK, professor, what does it mean?"
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Maybe, maybe, OK? Breaking your leg hurts like hell, OK? "Hel." They do it below the knee, "lo." "Hel-lo," gettit? They do it twice -- twice, "two." "Hello two." And the jigsaw must mean "you." "Hello to you.""
2,3,CAT,-1.000000,"I wouldn't like to be around when one of these suckers is making a speech!"
2,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Hang on -- the black box. Holly, the black box will have recorded everything won't it?"
2,3,HOLLY,-0.333333,"Yeah, hang on -- I'll fish it out.  It's gone! It's been half-inched. Wait a minute let me think about this. It gives off a signal. We can trace it."
2,3,LISTER,0.500000,"It's the gearbox, man. I'm telling you."
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Nothing yet."
2,3,LISTER,-0.333333,"This is impossible. It could be anywhere. It's like trying to find a fart in a jacuzzi."
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Look! Down there on that moon."
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Are you getting a picture now?"
2,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Yeah but the quality's terrible. It's like watching Spanish television."
2,3,LISTER,1.000000,"Oh my god!"
2,3,CAT,-1.000000,"What the hell is that?"
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Smegorama!"
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Err, what is it?"
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"It's a footprint the size of a surfboard."
2,3,CAT,-1.000000,"I don't believe the size of these feet. Can you imagine the problems this guy must have trying to get fashionable shoes?"
2,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"I wonder if it's true what they about the size of your feet? I mean, if it is this guy could probably go to a fancy dress party as a petrol pump."
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"I think you should come back."
2,3,LISTER,0.500000,"There's more of them. They lead round this corner."
2,3,RIMMER,-0.666667,"So, a surfboard-foot sized monster came aboard, did a jigsaw, drained our memories and broke a couple of legs. So what? "Forgive and forget" is what I say."
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"This I don't believe! It's a gravestone.  "To the memory..." "To the memory of Lise Yates.""
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Who's Lise Yates?"
2,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"You're not going to believe this, but I used to go out with a girl called Lise Yates. It's only shallow, the black box is buried in the grave."
2,3,HOLLY,1.000000,"Right, it's loaded."
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Well play it, sam."
2,3,HOLLY,0.000000,"Nice looking bloke."
2,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Why have you frozen him, Hol?"
2,3,HOLLY,0.500000,"You heard what he said. Knows what he's talking about, that dude."
2,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Come on, Hol, from Saturday night."
2,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Yes, well we all remember this bit. Spin on, spin on, spin on!"
2,3,CAT,0.000000,"How many?"
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Him?"
2,3,CAT,0.000000,"Yes!"
2,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"No, no."
2,3,CAT,0.000000,"Him.  That Many?"
2,3,CAT,0.000000,"This better be good. I was sleeping, and sleeping's my third favourite thing! And you come and wake me up this time of night."
2,3,CAT,0.000000,"What is this place?"
2,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"It's the hologram simulation suite. This is the room that creates Rimmer."
2,3,CAT,0.000000,"Have we come to blow this room up?"
2,3,LISTER,0.500000,"Look, those are his dreams and everything there.  Look, that's what he's dreaming right at the moment."
2,3,LISTER,1.000000,"I'm going to give Rimmer the best present he will ever get."
2,3,CAT,0.000000,"What are you doing with that?"
2,3,LISTER,1.000000,"I'm recording my memory."
2,3,CAT,0.000000,"Your entire memory?"
2,3,LISTER,0.333333,"Yeah, everything. Everywhere I've been, everything I've learnt, my entire knowledge.  Right, that's it.  I'm going to give Rimmer a love affair. I'm going to take eight months out of my memory and I'm going to paste it into his. So everything that's happened to me he's going to think happened to him."
2,3,CAT,0.000000,"You're going to give him one of your old girlfriends?"
2,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"I'm going to give him Lise Yates."
2,3,LISTER,1.000000,"And I love you Lise."
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"A few minor adjustments."
2,3,LISTER,1.000000,"And I love you Lise."
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Change the voice."
2,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"And I love you Lise."
2,3,LISTER,1.000000,"And that's it."
2,3,CAT,0.000000,"And when he wakes up he'll think all this happened to him?"
2,3,LISTER,1.000000,"Yeah, the whole eight months."
2,3,CAT,0.000000,"Man, that's a fine present.  He was probably only expecting a tie."
2,3,LISTER,1.000000,"You're in a good mood."
2,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Why not Listy? When life's so good?"
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Why is life so good?"
2,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"You wouldn't understand, Lister, you've never been in love."
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"I have!"
2,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Oh, not real love, Lister, not like I have. Not fireworks-in- the-sky, from-here-to-eternity, rolling-naked-on-the-beach kind of love. Not like me and Lise."
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"So, who's Lise?"
2,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Never you mind, Lister. Someone who was absolutely nuts about me, that's all you need to know."
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Fine, if you want to keep it to yourself."
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"All I'm saying is, from now on call me "Tiger.""
2,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"An old girlfriend, was she? Tiger."
2,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"What a crazy, crazy year that was. The first three months I was at Saturn Tech doing a maintenance course. Then for absolutely no reason I suddenly moved to Liverpool. I drank too much, I smoked too much, I became a total slob. I met Lise, of course. I even started to eat my own toenail clippings."
2,3,RIMMER,-0.333333,"My tastes in music radically changed. I stopped adoring Mantovani and got into Rastabilly Skank. Crazy!"
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Well, you know, you were in love. You go a bit crazy."
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"It was weird. I was absolutely nuts about her but yet I started to treat her really badly."
2,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"No you didn't!"
2,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"I did! I started to give her some wishy washy twaddle about not wanting to get tied down."
2,3,LISTER,-0.333333,"But you were young! You didn't want to settle down. You wanted to bum around and have a laugh."
2,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"But I hate bumming around and having a laugh."
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"But that's what you're like when you're young."
2,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"But I wasn't like that when I was young, so why did I say those things?"
2,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"But, I mean, she wanted you to have a career."
2,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"That's what I'd always dreamt of, so why did I finish it with her?"
2,3,LISTER,1.000000,"Because, you wanted to play the field."
2,3,RIMMER,0.400000,"That's right. I told her I wanted to play the field. I told her that. I must have been mad. She was great and she thought I was great."
2,3,LISTER,0.500000,"Yeah, man, you're right. You were mad."
2,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"She was a lover and a friend."
2,3,LISTER,1.000000,"And beautiful."
2,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"Gorgeous."
2,3,LISTER,1.000000,"Great sense of humour."
2,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"Terrific."
2,3,LISTER,1.000000,"The sex was fantastic."
2,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"Amazing sex."
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Brilliant sex."
2,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"Oh, primo dynamite sex!"
2,3,LISTER,0.500000,"Fantastic sex! Stupendous sex!"
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Lister!"
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"The way she used to-- Oh..."
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Lister!"
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Oh, sex. Brilliant sex."
2,3,RIMMER,0.500000,"Lister, Lister! How do you know?"
2,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"I'm just having a guess."
2,3,RIMMER,0.500000,"Kindly don't. No one will ever know how beautiful the relationship between me and Lise Yates was."
2,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"How could you do this to me? It's the most heart breakingly tragic thing it's ever been my misfortune to witness."
2,3,CAT,0.000000,"Popcorn?"
2,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Look, I'm sorry, man. I mean, obviously I thought I was doing you a favour."
2,3,HOLLY,-1.000000,"What's all this got to do with jigsaws, broken legs, and Godzilla-size footprints, eh?"
2,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Right, smeg brain, prepare to die!"
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Eh?"
2,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"I found the letters."
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"What letters?"
2,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Don't give me "What letters?" The letters."
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"WHAT letters?"
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"You went out with Lise Yates too. I found the letters she sent you."
2,3,LISTER,1.000000,"Oh, smeg!"
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"All the time she was going out with me she must have been seeing you as well, behind my back. And what is more, to pour salt into the wound, you used to take her to the exact same places I used to take her and do the exact same things."
2,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Rimmer, it's not what it looks like."
2,3,RIMMER,-0.333333,"That woman is unbelievable. We spent a night in a hotel in Southport and made love six times. According to her letter you were in the exact same hotel and you made love six times too."
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Listen."
2,3,RIMMER,0.333333,"Twelve times a night? What is wrong with the woman? She's sex mad!"
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Listen!"
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"It's a good job you were there. If I'd been on my own I'd have been dead within a week. But it doesn't make sense. I mean, she loved me."
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Listen, listen. She wasn't going out with us both at the same time."
2,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Come on, I've checked the dates."
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"She wasn't going out with you at all."
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"She ... She didn't go out with me at all?"
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"No, you've never even met her."
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Is that the best you can do, Lister? That's below feeble."
2,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"I went down to the hologram simulation suite and I gave you eight months of my memory."
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"What?"
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"It was a present."
2,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"You gave me eight months of your memory, as a present?"
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah."
2,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"That's why I was an orphan, even though my parents were alive. That's why I had my appendix out ... twice."
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"I thought it was what you needed."
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"You've destroyed me, Lister. The woman I loved most in the whole world didn't love me, she loved you."
2,3,LISTER,0.250000,"Rimmer, listen.  Rimmer, listen. Rimmer! Oh Smeg!"
2,3,CAT,0.000000,"You should have bought him a tie."
2,3,LISTER,1.000000,"Come on, Rimmer, you've experienced love. It made you more confident, more secure."
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"It didn't happen. I never even met her."
2,3,LISTER,-0.333333,"It did happen. I mean, you fell in love with her in a way I never did. She's yours now and nothing can take her away from you."
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"That time she stuck her tongue down my ear. It wasn't my ear at all -- it was your ear. The woman I loved most in the whole world had her tongue down your ear. The most romantic thing I've ever had down my ear is a Johnson's baby bud."
2,3,LISTER,-0.166667,"Come on, as far as you're concerned you had a love affair, right? Which was wonderful, yeah? And for some reason that you can't understand it all went hideously wrong. Well, so what? Join the club, bucko. It's just you, me, and everybody else in the world."
2,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I don't want to feel like this any more."
2,3,LISTER,-0.333333,"So, so you're in pain, yeah? I know, but Rimmer, if you go through life without feeling, if you go through life never experiencing, you're no better than a jellyfish. No better than a bank manager."
2,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I don't want this feeling any more. I want my own memory back."
2,3,LISTER,0.666667,"OK, OK, OK. I'll erase the last four days. The incident will never have happened."
2,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"But you'll know about it!"
2,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well I'll erase my memory from Sunday too."
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"And the Cat's and Holly's."
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Fine, if they agree."
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"And what about the black box."
2,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"I'll destroy it."
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"It's indestructible."
2,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"OK, I'll shoot it off into space."
2,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Someone might find it."
2,3,LISTER,0.333333,"OK, OK. We'll bury it. We'll bury it on some planet, yeah?"
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"I'm going to drop it, I'm going to drop it! Put it down man, put it down!"
2,3,CAT,-1.000000,"Why does he want a grave stone?"
2,3,LISTER,0.000000,"He said he just wanted something somewhere. So it didn't, like, disappear."
2,3,LISTER,-0.250000,"Aaaagggghh! My foot! I've broken my foot! It's broken!"
2,3,CAT,-1.000000,"Help me find my toes."
2,3,LISTER,0.500000,"OK, that's it.  Let's go and erase our memories."
2,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"Three million years from Earth, the mining ship Red Dwarf. Its crew: Dave Lister, the last human being alive; Arnold Rimmer, a hologram of his dead bunkmate; and a creature who evolved from the ship's cat. Message ends."
2,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Sir, I wish to place on record that third technician Lister, David--"
2,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"--smuggled aboard the mining vessel Red Dwarf a consignment of a hallucinogenic fungi "Titan Mushrooms," more popularly known to the Space Beatnik community as "Freaky Fungus.""
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Erm, sort of."
2,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"And on the morning of Febuary the 26th, at 0800 hrs, did engage in conversation with second technician Rimmer, Arnold J.--"
2,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"--the outcome of which was a proposal by the aforementioned Lister to the aforementioned Rimmer to cook him breakfast."
2,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Breakfast comprised of two eggs, three rashers of bacon, a grilled tomato, two sausages, a small portion of fried potatoes... and a large quantity of mushrooms. Having consumed this repast, second technician Rimmer, Arnold J. experienced what can only be described as a voyage to trip-out city. To whit, a major hallucinogenic fit."
2,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"No, sir. I'm sure it was only one egg."
2,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"The aforementioned Rimmer, to whit, me, then attended inspection parade. He was totally naked except for a pair of mock-leather driving gloves and some blue swimming goggles. Under the influence of this psychadelic breakfast he went on to attack two senior officers, believing them to be giraffes who were armed and dangerous."
2,4,LISTER,1.000000,"I have, sir."
2,4,LISTER,1.000000,"I thought it'd be a laugh."
2,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"With respect, sir, the penalty for a crime of this nature is fifteen years imprisonment."
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"<>"
2,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Two weeks?"
2,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Two smegging weeks?"
2,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"With repect, sir, you've got your head right up your big fat arse."
2,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Eight weeks PD! How come I get eight weeks and you get only two? What did I do to deserve that? What did I do?"
2,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"You shouldn't have stuck your pencil up his nose!"
2,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"It was the rubber end! Plus, the doctor will get it out in no time."
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"You ripped up and ate his wife's photograph."
2,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"I didn't know it was his wife. I thought it was a publicity shot for "Planet Of The Apes.""
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Two teas."
2,4,LISTER,-1.333333,"Listen, man, I'm sorry about those mushrooms, you know. I mean, I didn't know... I'm not totally reckless and irresponsible, for God's sake. I mean, when it comes down to it, I'm a pretty straight and honest geezer."
2,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Where did you get them?"
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"I nicked them. They were in a locker. They must have belonged to Headbanger Harris."
2,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Why didn't you tell the Captain this?"
2,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"What? And get someone into trouble?"
2,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Oh, no. Eight weeks painting the smegging ship?"
2,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"I'm sorry."
2,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Get the space-suits."
2,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Good book?"
2,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Yeah, it's alright."
2,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"I didn't think you read."
2,4,LISTER,1.000000,"Not much, but this is good."
2,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"What is it?"
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"It's your diary."
2,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"WHAT!?"
2,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"I didn't know you sent secret love letters to Carol McCauley."
2,4,RIMMER,1.000000,"Lister, that is my private, personal, private diary; full of my personal, private, personal things."
2,4,CAT,0.000000,"It's gone public."
2,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"I don't believe it! You've been reading that to the Cat?"

2,4,LISTER,0.000000,""Your hair is like a golden waterfall.""
2,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Shut up."
2,4,LISTER,-1.000000,""Plus, those tight skirts you wear make me really horny.""
2,4,RIMMER,1.000000,"Lister, I order you to shut your face."
2,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"It's no big deal, you know. You can read my diary."
2,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Who'd want to read your diary? It's full of puerile nonsense about Kristine Kochanski."
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Ah, So you've read my diary."
2,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Yes, but at least I have the common decency to do it sneakily behind your back."
2,4,CAT,1.500000,"He's right. That is definitely the decent thing to do!"
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"I'm doing it for a reason anyway. Look what I found in Kochanski's quarters this morning."
2,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"So?"
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Look at it!"
2,4,RIMMER,1.000000,"It's a wedding photograph."
2,4,LISTER,1.000000,"Yeah, And who is the incredibly gorgeous hunky beefcake she is marrying?"
2,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"It's you! But you didn't marry Kochanski!"
2,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"Exactly! So how is this possible, unless somehow we go back in time?"
2,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"What's this got to do with my diary?"
2,4,LISTER,-0.333333,"It's this bit here about the mushrooms, isn't it. You see, when you saw your head coming through the table, I don't think it was an hallucination. I think you were seeing you, now, arriving back in the past."
2,4,CAT,0.500000,"There's a wise old Cat saying which I think applies in this situation. It goes: "What are you talking about, dog-breath?""
2,4,LISTER,-0.400000,"Listen to what it said. It says; "The head came through the table and said, `I'm from the future. I've come to save your life. We found a stasis leak on floor sixteen.'" You see, I don't think it was an hallucination."
2,4,CAT,0.000000,"What's a stasis leak?"
2,4,HOLLY,0.500000,"Alright, dudes. What's going down in groove town then?"
2,4,LISTER,0.500000,"Alright, Hol. Listen, what's a stasis leak?"
2,4,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Um, well, very, very basically, putting it as simply as I can for your average layman to comprehend, a stasis leak is a leak, right, in stasis, hence the name "a stasis leak.""
2,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"You don't know, do you, Hol?"
2,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"No, I don't."
2,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well, I suggest we go down to floor sixteen and see what's there."
2,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"How come he never, ever knows anything? He's supposed to have an I.Q. of six thousand!"
2,4,HOLLY,-0.500000,"Six thousand's not that much. It's only the same IQ as twelve thousand car park attendants."
2,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"But you don't know anything."
2,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"Listen, I happen to be one of the sleekest, most sophisticated computers ever devised by man. I'm the nearest thing you can get to infullible."
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Infallible."
2,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"Exactly."
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Floor sixteen."
2,4,RIMMER,1.000000,"This is going to take ages."
2,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"I hate this stuff. It really freaks me out."
2,4,CAT,0.500000,"You should apologise for the chicken! First meal I ever had where the container tasted better than the food!"
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"This must be the stasis leak."
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Okay. Here we go."
2,4,LISTER,0.500000,"It's safe. Come through."
2,4,CAT,0.000000,"What IS it?"
2,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"It's a rent in the space-time continuum."
2,4,CAT,0.000000,"What IS it?"
2,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"The stasis room freezes time, you know, makes time stand still. So whenever you have a leak, it must preserve whatever it's leaked into, and it's leaked into this room."
2,4,CAT,0.000000,"What IS it?"
2,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"It's singularity, a point in the universe where the normal laws of space and time don't apply."
2,4,CAT,0.000000,"What IS it?"
2,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"It's a hole back into the past."
2,4,CAT,0.000000,"Oh, a magic door! Well, why didn't you say?"
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"March the twenty-second. That's what -- three weeks before the crew got wiped out."
2,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Hi."
2,4,CAT,0.000000,"Hi."
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Do you mind? This is the Annual General Meeting of the Agrophobics' Society!"
2,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"I wonder if we can bring anybody back?"
2,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Not unless we want them to be turned into powder."
2,4,CAT,0.000000,"Who were you thinking of bringing back?"
2,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Me."
2,4,CAT,1.000000,"Let's do it!"
2,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"What's the point in going, if you can't bring anybody back?"
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"You've seen the photograph. I'm going to marry her."
2,4,RIMMER,-0.666667,"But what's the point? In three weeks you'll be radioactive dust! You might as well marry a box of Daz."
2,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"I'm gonna stay with her."
2,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"You're going to stay with her? For the sake of three weeks together you're going to give up your life?"
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah."
2,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"I don't believe it. Lister, selfish or what?"
2,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Why?"
2,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"What about me? I've given you the best years of my death! Is that it, then? Three years, thanks a lot, pal, I'm off. No sort of regrets? Not so much as a lump in your throat? No, you're thinking of Kochanski. The only lump you've got is up the front of your trousers."
2,4,LISTER,-0.666667,"I'm going for it, Rimmer. If there's one thing I've learned, it's that you don't get many shots at happiness. So when you do, go for them all."
2,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I'm sharing a bunk with a character out of a Barbara Cartland novel."
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"What would you do in my place?"
2,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"I don't know, I... oh, do what you like."
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Where are you coming from, Rimmer? You don't even like me."
2,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Don't I?"
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"No."
2,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Fine."
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"You don't though, do you? You don't even like me."
2,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"That's what you think, is it?"
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah."
2,4,RIMMER,1.000000,"I will tell you something that will probably stun you rigid."
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"What?"
2,4,RIMMER,-0.714286,"You're right. I don't like you. I don't like what you stand for. But, for some weird reason... I don't know. What's the point? Everything always goes wrong for me. I'm probably the only person in the world to buy a Topic Bar without a single hazelnut in it."
2,4,LISTER,-0.200000,"It happens, you know, Rimmer. You meet people, then you move on, man. When I was ten, I had a friend called Duncan. Me best mate ever. He taught me everything. He was the one who showed me how to put mirrors on me toecaps so I could look up girl's skirts. Then his father had to move to Spain because of a job. It was a bank job he pulled in Perlie. Never saw him again. I still think of him, though... every time I look at me shoes."
2,4,RIMMER,-0.538462,"Don't try and explain it, Lister. I don't know why I'm even surprised. Everyone always leaves me in the end. Girls, parents... I had a pet lemming once. I loved that little lemming. I built him a little wall so he could hurl himself over it. He didn't want for anything. I'll never forget one Christmas I put my finger in his cage to give him some mince pie. He bit me! He sunk his teeth right into my fingers and wouldn't let go. In the end I had to smash his brains out against the wall. That little lemming broke my heart. The little git completely ruined my helicopter wallpaper."
2,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"You know, maybe there is a way to bring people back from the past."
2,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Oh, how?"
2,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well, there's a spare stasis booth, isn't there? We could bring one person back if we could persuade them to go into suspended animation."
2,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"They'd survive the accident."
2,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"Yeah. And when we got back to now, we could bring them out and bingo!"
2,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Brilliant! I could save my own life! I wouldn't be dead!"
2,4,LISTER,1.000000,"Just think -- I could bring her back!"
2,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I could bring me back! There'd be two me's -- a dead me and a living me -- one for the week and one for Sunday best."
2,4,LISTER,0.500000,"Hey! There's only room for one and that's Krissie!"
2,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Rimmsie!"
2,4,CAT,-0.250000,"Aaaoooow! Don't look, baby, It'll drive you crazy!  Hey, what do you think? You said "look inconspicuous.""
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Put this on."
2,4,CAT,0.000000,"What?"
2,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"You'll stand out a mile like that."
2,4,CAT,-1.000000,"I wouldn't use this to buff my shoes!"
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Look, you can't walk round a mining ship looking like a finalist from "Come Jiving.""
2,4,CAT,-1.000000,"But then everyone will think I'm just an ordinary person!"
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"That's the point."
2,4,CAT,1.000000,"They won't look at me and say "Who's that guy? He's gorgeous!""
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Put it on."
2,4,CAT,-0.500000,"Ugh. Well, maybe if I widen the lapels a bit, put in a couple of spangels and sequins and shoulder-pads..."
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Put it on!"
2,4,CAT,0.000000,"Where's Alphabet-Head?"
2,4,LISTER,-0.666667,"Rimmer? He sneaked off last night. He's already back in the past, trying to save his own worthless life."
2,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"You reading me, Hol?"
2,4,HOLLY,0.500000,"Eugh. I could see right down your gob."
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Let's go."
2,4,HOLLY,-1.333333,"I don't like being a watch, dangling about all sideways and upside down. And give me fair warning before you put your hand in your pocket. Gave me such a fright last time, that huge liquorice allsort covered in fluff."
2,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Oh, cheers, Hol."
2,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"Oh, here we go again."
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Put that on!"
2,4,LISTER,-0.333333,"Here it is, man. Just stick with me, okay? Okay."
2,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Excuse me, did you order a kiss-o-gram?"
2,4,CAT,-1.000000,"Excuse me, did you see a short human with pigtails coming through here?"
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Yo, Cat!"
2,4,CAT,-0.500000,"Never mind. It's the personality that counts."
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Petersen!"
2,4,LISTER,0.500000,"Petersen, how are you, mate? I don't believe it, it's you! I've missed you, you know. Give us a kiss, you smelly-arsed smegger."
2,4,LISTER,1.000000,"I don't believe it -- it's really you!"
2,4,LISTER,1.000000,"I'll see you later!"
2,4,LISTER,0.500000,"No, I promise. I'll come to your room and see you."
2,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"That was Petersen, an old mate o' mine. We were like that. I never thought... I mean, just think, I'm gonna be able to see everybody again."
2,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"Oy, give us a break, Dave. It's like a tropical rain forest in there."
2,4,LISTER,1.000000,"Sorry, Hol."
2,4,CAT,0.000000,"Waaaooow! I've never been this close to women before! It makes me wanna do something. I don't know what it is, but I want to do a lot of it!"
2,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Excuse me."
2,4,RIMMER,0.200000,"I don't want you to panic, Arnold. I want you to stay absolutely calm. I'm coming out in a moment, and I want you to keep your cool. Are you ready? Here I come."
2,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I found a stasis leak on floor sixteen. I'm dead now, and you're not, but if I save you, you won't die, so I won't die, and you won't be dead either, and neither will I."
2,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"You do?"
2,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"What?"
2,4,RIMMER,-0.333333,"No, look. I'm you from the future. I've come to warn you, in three million years you'll be dead."
2,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Yes. unless you do something about it now."
2,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"You're not listening! You've got to go into stasis."
2,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"I'll be back soon."
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Hi. Is Kristine in?"
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Smeg. Did she say where she was staying?"
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Cheers."
2,4,CAT,0.000000,"No, I haven't."
2,4,CAT,0.000000,"Aaargh! Dog! And he's trying to strangle that woman!"
2,4,CAT,-1.000000,"Don't worry, madam -- his strangling days are over!"
2,4,LISTER,0.250000,"Cat, I've got it. C'mon. Room 008. This way!"
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"She's already married."
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"What about the photograph?"
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"I'm not the groom.  He is the groom!"
2,4,CAT,-1.000000,"Hey -- she's not as stupid as we thought!"
2,4,LISTER,-0.111111,"Why do women always leave me for total smegheads? Why do they dump me for men who wear turtleneck sweaters and smoke a pipe? I mean, natural yoghurt eaters! Reliable, sensible, dependable, and lots of other words that end in "-ible." He's obsessed with house-prices, and spends half his life in antique fairs looking for bargains and drinking wine. It's never beer, is it, it's always wine! "What do you want on your cornflakes, darling?" "Oh, I'll have some wine, please!" Smeg!"
2,4,CAT,0.000000,"You can tell all that, just from a photograph?"
2,4,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Oy, not your pockets! Dear oh dear, It's horrible down there. There's a big hole. It's an unbelievable view. Reminds me of that film -- "Attack Of The Killer Gooseberries.""
2,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Come on, Hol. I'm broken up, man."
2,4,HOLLY,-0.333333,"I was in love once -- a Sinclair ZX-81. People said, "No, Holly, she's not for you." She was cheap, she was stupid and she wouldn't load -- well, not for me, anyway."
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"What are you trying to say, Hol?"
2,4,HOLLY,-1.000000,"What I'm saying, Dave, is that it's better to have loved and to have lost than to listen to an album by Olivia Newton-John."
2,4,CAT,0.000000,"Why's that?"
2,4,HOLLY,1.000000,"Anything's better than listening to an album by Olivia Newton- John."
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Oh. Hi."
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"No, no, we were just passin'."
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"No, no, really, it's okay."
2,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"Cat! Come on, We've got to go!"
2,4,CAT,0.000000,"Aooooowww!"
2,4,LISTER,1.000000,"Oh, great."
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Oh."
2,4,LISTER,1.000000,"Oh, I bet."
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"I'd rather have a hammer."

2,4,CAT,-1.000000,"What is this, a meeting of the ugly convention?"
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Where did you come from?"
2,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well, quite frankly, I'm not. I mean, I came here today 'cos I thought I was going to get married."
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"No, he did!"
2,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"No, I'm me."
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"He's him..."
2,4,CAT,0.000000,"He's you and you're him, and you're him and he's him -- am I still me? Who's eatin' this chicken? What the hell is going on??"
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"So it does work out?"
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"So how about a frenchie from me future bride?"
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"So, listen. What do I do now?"
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Have I always been such a smeg-head? Or did I change?"
2,4,LISTER,0.333333,"So, listen, man. You've lived my life for the last five years. So, what's the single most important piece of advice that you can give me?"
2,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Smeg head."
2,4,RIMMER,1.000000,"I don't want you to panic, Arnold, but I've had a jolly good think, and I think I know how to explain this to you."
2,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Hi."
2,4,RIMMER,1.000000,"Good."
2,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"Yo, Rimmer, there you are. I've been looking everywhere."
2,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Not now, Lister."
2,4,CAT,1.000000,"Hey, I'm a cat!"
2,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"Three million years from Earth, the mining ship Red Dwarf. It's crew: Dave Lister, the last human being alive; Arnold Rimmer, a hologram of his dead bunkmate and a creature who evolved from the ship's cat. Message ends."
2,5,LISTER,-0.200000,""19. When you are alone in bed, what do you wear? Is it: A, nothing at all, B, a flannelette nightie, or C, a sexy black negligee?" C. "20. Do you think your boobs are: A, too small, B, just right or C, too large?" Definitely too large! So what's me rating? "Mainly C's: You sure are one foxy lady: sexy, sensual and you don't mind showing it." Yee-es! I'm a sex beast!"
2,5,CAT,-1.000000,"Yow, Yeah, Yee-oww, oooh, yea-oww!"
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Do you mind?!"
2,5,CAT,0.500000,"What? Yeaaah, yeee-owww!"
2,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I'm trying to concentrate."

2,5,LISTER,0.000000,""Robert Hardy reads 'Tess Of The D'Urbevilles'"?!? Let's have a listen."
2,5,LISTER,1.500000,"The tape must have got twisted, man! This is really good!"
2,5,RIMMER,-0.500000,"EXCUSE ME!!! I'm in the middle of a tactical calculation which could well swing this entire game."
2,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Rimmer, you've lost, man."
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"It's true. He has only one piece left, stuck up in one corner and surrounded by the skutter's double pieces."
2,5,RIMMER,1.000000,"There's plenty of <space for manouver.>"
2,5,LISTER,1.000000,"You've only got one move you can make and then he zaps you."
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Admittedly, at first glance that is indeed the way it looks. What you're failing to take into consideration is that El Skutto here has to go back on duty in.. ... 4 minutes and 31 seconds. And if he goes before the game is concluded, I win by default. 4 minutes, 15.  Riiimm-eerr! Riiimm-eerr! Riimer, Riimer!"
2,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"You're a piece of dirty filthy cheating scum, aren't you?"
2,5,RIMMER,-0.666667,"Absolutement! And that is why I'll win.Because I have the ability to think my way round problems rather than sticking to the straight, pre- programmed lines. That's why men are so better than machines."
2,5,LISTER,-0.166667,"Oh, I don't know, you know. I had this Geography teacher, Miss Foster. She took us on a school summer camp trip to Deganwy. I had the tent next to hers, right. And in the middle of the night I was woken up by this really weird noise. She didn't think men were better than machines."
2,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"What's happening then, dudes?"
2,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Oh, bog all."
2,5,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Hey up, I've forgotten what I was going to say now."
2,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Well, it can't be that important, then, can it?"
2,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"That's it, yeah. Look out, a meteor is about to hit the ship. I knew it would come back to me."
2,5,CAT,0.000000,"Thanks for the warning!"
2,5,HOLLY,-1.000000,"I'm sorry, I've not been very well lately."
2,5,LISTER,0.000000,"What's wrong with you, Holly?"
2,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"He's computer-senile, that's what's wrong with him."
2,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Is there any damage?"
2,5,HOLLY,-0.500000,"I don't know. The damage-report machine' been damaged."
2,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well, where did it hit?"
2,5,HOLLY,-1.000000,"I'm not sure, all me monitors are out. Round about floor 591, I think."
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"You're about as much use as a condom machine in the Vatican."
2,5,LISTER,-0.500000,"Well, there's nothing here. Let's check 592."
2,5,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Umm... has anybody seen my legs? They don't appear to be below my waist where I normally keep them."
2,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Holly, what's happened to Rimmer's legs?"
2,5,CAT,1.000000,"Here they are right here!"
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Stop them!"
2,5,LISTER,0.500000,"C'mon, leggies, this way! Over here."
2,5,HOLLY,-0.500000,"It must have been 592. That's where the Hologram Simulation Suite is!"
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"What does this mean?"
2,5,HOLLY,-1.000000,"It's probably not serious, don't panic."
2,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Well, when it's not serious when your genitals can go wandering off on their own, I wonder what is?"
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Wait for mememememememe!"
2,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"Here it is. 592."
2,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Rimmer, are you alright?"
2,5,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Well, you see, the shuttle was late, the shuttle was late. And they're usually so good, they're so good, aren't they?"
2,5,CAT,0.000000,"What's happened to him?"
2,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"He's turned into Brannigan, the ship's psychiatrist."
2,5,HOLLY,-1.000000,"We'd better get him fixed."
2,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"It's all in hand. No panic."
2,5,RIMMER,-0.500000,"No panic everyone. It's all in hand."
2,5,HOLLY,-1.000000,"You just need to override the charred relays, Dave."
2,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"You just need to override the charred relays, Dave."
2,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Well, How do you do that, Holly?"
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Well, How do you do that, Holly?"
2,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"Bypass the main circuit. That ring of switches over there."
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Bypass the main circuit. That ring of switches over there."
2,5,LISTER,0.000000,"What, this one over here?"
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"What, this one over here?"
2,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"Yeah, that one."
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Yeah, that one."
2,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"Now press the bypass."
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Now press the bypass."
2,5,RIMMER,-0.666667,"Ugh! That was horrible. I never want to go through that again!"
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Aaaaaooow! Yeeeeeeaaaah! Aaaaaaaaooooowwwwhhhhhaaaa!"
2,5,CAT,0.500000,"Hey! Now he's me!"
2,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"It's a loose cable. Put the red plug in the blue socket."
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Is that it over? Are we okay now?"
2,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"Yes."
2,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Shouldn't this plug into something?"
2,5,HOLLY,1.000000,"Oh yeah, that joins up with the white cable."
2,5,LISTER,0.000000,"The white cable?"
2,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"Yeah."
2,5,HOLLY,-0.500000,"...or is it the yellow cable? Yes, it should have been the yellow cable."
2,5,RIMMER,-0.500000,"You are a total, total... a word has yet to be invented to describe how totally whatever-it-is you are, but you are one. And a total, total one at that."
2,5,HOLLY,1.000000,"Alright, keep your hair on."
2,5,RIMMER,1.000000,"I'm lucky if I can keep my legs on with you in charge!"
2,5,CAT,1.000000,"Yeah, he's out to lunch, man!"
2,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"He's out to lunch, breakfast, dinner, tea, supper, the lot! He's not in for a single meal, if you ask me!"
2,5,CAT,0.000000,"Hey, who's that?"
2,5,RIMMER,1.000000,"Aliens!"
2,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"Queeg."
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Who's Queeg?"
2,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"This is mutiny, Mr. Queeg. I'll see you swing from the highest yard-arm in Titan Docking Port for this day's work."
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"What's Article Five?"
2,5,LISTER,-0.500000,"Hang on, he can't do this. Holly's got an IQ of six thousand!"
2,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"Yeah. Right on."
2,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Well, what is it, then?"
2,5,CAT,0.000000,"What is it?"
2,5,HOLLY,-0.333333,"Six? Do me a lemon! That's a poor IQ for a glass of water!"
2,5,LISTER,0.000000,"How come he knows the answers to all the questions about science and space that we ask him?"
2,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"What a slimeball!"
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"What book?"
2,5,HOLLY,1.000000,"That's slander, that is. You'd better find yourself a good lawyer, sunshine."
2,5,CAT,-1.000000,"So that's why he's never on the case!"
2,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"I am on the case. I'm sharp. I'm kicking bottom."
2,5,LISTER,0.000000,"How come he can navigate us back to Earth?"
2,5,LISTER,0.000000,"You what?"
2,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"A load of tottenham, that is. A steaming pile of hotspur. I'm wise to his game. He's turning you against me so he can take over."
2,5,HOLLY,1.000000,"I'm in my prime!"
2,5,RIMMER,-0.400000,"Ah, Lister, this is all a bit different, isn't it? Those skutters, charging up and down the corridor, polishing, repairing, sweeping. The lifts are fixed. The fire extinguishers work. And when I say 'work', I mean they work when you turn them on, as opposed to when you happen to pass them and cough, as they did under Holly's regime."
2,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah, I suppose."
2,5,RIMMER,-0.600000,"Look, Lister, no point feeling sorry about Holly. It's a kindness. Like a blind old incontinent sheepdog, he's had his day. Take him out to the barn with a double-barreled shot-gun and blow the mother away. And I'm only saying that because I'm so fond of him."
2,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Just think how Holly feels!?"
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Feels? He never feels anything, Lister. He's a computer."
2,5,LISTER,-0.333333,"He still feels. In fact, sometimes i think it's cruel giving machines a personality. My mate Petersen once brought a pair of shoes with artificial intelligence. Smart Shoes, they were called. It was a neat idea. No matter how blind drunk you were, they would always get you home. Then he got ratted one night in Oslo, and woke up the next morning in Burma. See, the shoes got bored just going from his local to the flat. They wanted to see the world, man, y'know? He had a helluva job getting rid of them. No matter who he sold them to, they'd show up again the next day! He tried to shut them out, but they just kicked the door down, y'know?"
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Is this true?"
2,5,LISTER,-0.666667,"Yeah! Last thing he heard, they'd sort of, erm, robbed a car and drove it into a canal. They couldn't steer, y'see."
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Really?!"
2,5,LISTER,-0.800000,"Yeah. Petersen was really, really blown away by it. He went to see a preist. The preist told him, he said, it was alright, and all that, and the shoes were happy, and they'd gone to heaven. Y'see, it turns out shoes have soles."
2,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Well, what a sad, sad story."
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Wait a minute! How did they open the car door?"
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Off!"
2,5,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Uh, Queeg? Why has my alarm clock gone off at six o'clock?"
2,5,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Ah, now, Holly and I had this little understanding. I Would say "Holly, wake me up at six o'clock without fail," then Holly would pretend to forget, and wake me up around ten with breakfast. OK?"
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Off!"
2,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Queeg, I can see we've already cultivated a special understanding: I scratch your back and you stick a knife in mine. All right, give me a uniform."
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Ah, yes. Now once again, Holly, bless his little interface leads, and I, had this understanding..."
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"What are you doing?!?"
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"but I don't want to! Stop it!"
2,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"You just can't take over control of my body willy-nilly!"
2,5,RIMMER,1.000000,"Lister, help me, wake up, Lister, help me!"
2,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"What the hell's going on?"
2,5,RIMMER,1.000000,"Queeg is making me fit!"
2,5,RIMMER,-0.500000,"What are you doing? Sit ups? God, no! My stomach won't take it, it's too flabby!"
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Mummy!"
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Mercy!"
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Help me!"
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"HollyandIhadthislittleunderstanding!"
2,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Yee-es! Fight that flab!"
2,5,RIMMER,0.333333,"I want control of my own body! Getting fit is going to kill me! I'll get a bike!"
2,5,CAT,0.000000,"I said food! Is anybody home?"
2,5,LISTER,0.000000,"What's the matter with him?"
2,5,LISTER,0.000000,"What, you made him jog two and a half miles unconscious?"
2,5,LISTER,0.500000,"Yee-es! Nice one, Queeg!"
2,5,CAT,-1.000000,"Hey, I can't get any food!"
2,5,LISTER,1.000000,"Try a different machine."
2,5,CAT,0.000000,"I tried them all!"
2,5,CAT,0.000000,"They've all gone crazy!"
2,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Queeg, what's happened to the machines?"
2,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Naah. Listen, me and Holly, we had this little understanding..."
2,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Work?"
2,5,CAT,-1.000000,"You'd better get to it, 'cos you're looking at one hungry pussycat."
2,5,CAT,-0.333333,"Hey, hey! Woah, woah, woah, I do not do the "W" word. Cats do NOT work!"
2,5,LISTER,1.000000,"I've got a note from me mum."
2,5,CAT,0.000000,"Not this pussy!"
2,5,CAT,-0.333333,"I can't believe I'm doin' this! Look at me, I'm disgusting! I look like you in your best clothes!"
2,5,LISTER,0.500000,"Look, it's easy. Keep imagining the floor as Queeg's face."
2,5,CAT,1.000000,"Aw, look at my hands! I had lovely hands!"
2,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well, wear the smegging gloves!"
2,5,CAT,-0.333333,"Marigold with blue? Are you crazy? How long do we have to do this for, anyway?"
2,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"We've only been doing it ten minutes!"
2,5,CAT,-1.000000,"Ten minutes too long."
2,5,LISTER,1.000000,"We've got to do it all day."
2,5,CAT,0.000000,"What!?! All day? The whole entire day? What about naps? I'm a cat: I need some naps. If I don't nap nine or ten times a day, I don't have enough energy for my main snooze."
2,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"Halt! Who goes there: friend or foe?"
2,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Holly!"
2,5,CAT,0.666667,"How ya doin'? This is great! Hey, let me wipe your screen."
2,5,LISTER,0.000000,"So how's it goin'?"
2,5,CAT,0.000000,"Yeah, what you been up to, man?"
2,5,HOLLY,-0.200000,"Oh, this nightwatchman lark keeps me busy. Shining me torch down corridors. Turning it off. Shining it again. Life's full."
2,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"We can't go on like this, Holly."
2,5,CAT,0.250000,"Yeah. Queeg has got to go! Look what he's done to my cuticles! The man is a maniac!"
2,5,RIMMER,1.000000,"I agree!"
2,5,LISTER,1.000000,"He's got us working, otherwise we don't eat!"
2,5,HOLLY,0.250000,"Well, no doubt he knows what he's doing. unlike certain senile gibbering wrecks of computers we could mention. Still, it was nice to see everyone rallying round defending me to the hilt. Different story now, innit?"
2,5,LISTER,1.000000,"Well, I defended you."
2,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"Oh, I remember it well. Queeg says I've got an IQ of six, and you immediately leap to my defence, saying "Really? That explains everything!""
2,5,LISTER,0.500000,"No. That waas Rimmer!"
2,5,HOLLY,-0.500000,"Nevertheless. The fact remains that there are certain characters on this ship that don't believe my IQ is six thousand."
2,5,LISTER,1.000000,"I believe you."
2,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"I could prove it if i wanted to."
2,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"There's no need."
2,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"I want you to prove it."
2,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well, okay, what's the square root of two thousand and forty- nine?"
2,5,HOLLY,-0.500000,"Oh. You want me to prove it, do you?"
2,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"No, no."
2,5,HOLLY,-0.500000,"Clearly you do. Clearly just doing the square root of two thousand and forty-nine prove I have an IQ of six thousand."
2,5,CAT,0.000000,"What is it?"
2,5,HOLLY,-1.000000,"You wouldn't prefer a sports question, would you?"
2,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Forget it, Holly, it's just not important."
2,5,HOLLY,0.333333,"It is for me. I've been impuned. I want to clear my name."
2,5,CAT,0.000000,"Well, what is the square root of two thousand and forty-nine?"
2,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"How about a space question?"
2,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Like what?"
2,5,HOLLY,-0.500000,"I don't know. Like... what's the nearest planet to the sun?"
2,5,LISTER,0.000000,"What's the nearest planet to the sun?"
2,5,HOLLY,0.500000,"Oh, easy. Easy-peasy. That's right down my particular field of expertise, that is. Your nearest basic planet to your actual sun is..."
2,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"Mercury."
2,5,LISTER,0.500000,"Yeah. That's right."
2,5,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Oh, ye of little faith."
2,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well, you've convinced me, Holly."
2,5,CAT,-1.000000,"Me too. So, are we getting rid of Queeg or what?"
2,5,HOLLY,1.000000,"Am I fully restored in your confidence as the right dude for the gig?"
2,5,HOLLY,1.000000,"I'll be in touch."
2,5,LISTER,1.000000,"He's taking the smeg!"
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Who is?"
2,5,LISTER,-0.142857,"Queeg. Look at what he's given me for dinner: a pea on toast. One pea. I tell you, I'm that far from cracking.  I've lost me pea! Oh, that's it! I've cracked."
2,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"He's just doing this to destroy your morale."
2,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Is he? Well, I want me pea back. It's my pea. I earned that pea! Where is it? I don't care if it's on the floor, if it's covered in fluff, even under the bed with my toenail clippings, I don't care where it is -- it's my pea, I earned it, I'm going to eat it no matter what!"
2,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"It flew off into your dirty-sock basket."
2,5,LISTER,0.000000,"I'll just have the toast."
2,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Why didn't we stick up for Holly?"
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"I did."
2,5,LISTER,0.000000,"You did? When?"
2,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"All right, I didn't."
2,5,LISTER,-0.500000,"NBobody did. It's terrible."
2,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"We thought we were getting something better."
2,5,LISTER,0.333333,"What about trust? What about fidelity? What about simple, basic honest friendship?"
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Friendship? Do you know how many people I've met in my life I could count on as friends? True friends?"
2,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well, if you count Inflatable Ingrid, your Polythene Pal, one."
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"I'll tell you.  None. I got burned once, and I learned my lesson. Don't trust anybody. There was this one lad. Porky Roebuck. I'd known him two years. We were almost family. His dad was secretely knocking off my mum, that's how close we were. Anyway, we were in the Space Scouts together."
2,5,LISTER,0.000000,"You were in the Space Scouts?"
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Oh, yeah.  "Pinkles, Squirmy. Flib Flab Flubber." We were fifteen years old. We went on this survival course, twenty-four hours out in the wilds, sleeping rough, surviving on wild berries and things."
2,5,LISTER,0.000000,"What, did you go to Butlins?"
2,5,RIMMER,-0.714286,"We were each given a swiss army knife. You only ate what you killed yourself. I remember ten of the boys got together and decided to eat me. They tied me to a stake, lit a fire, and poured barbecue sauce all over me. I remember thinking as I went round and round, "Porky will save me, he's my best friend." It turned out Porky was the ringleader and had actually bagsied my right buttock. If it hadn't been for Yakka-Takka-Tulla, the Space Mistress, I honestly believe they would have eaten me."
2,5,LISTER,0.333333,"Oh, come on, they were only bullying you. They would really have eaten you! You know what kids are like!"
2,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"the point is, Lister, friends are only friends when it suits them."
2,5,LISTER,1.000000,"Oh, lights."
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Lister? How did you know about Inflatable Ingrid?"
2,5,LISTER,0.000000,"I've been seeing her behind your back."
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Compute."
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Just one small question..."
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"What does "compute" mean?"
2,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"Queeg."
2,5,HOLLY,-1.000000,"I want my ship back."
2,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"Even if I have to fight for it."
2,5,LISTER,0.500000,"Steady on, Holly. This one's a nutter."
2,5,HOLLY,0.500000,"I challenge to the game of your choice. May the greater mind win."
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Oh, my God."
2,5,HOLLY,1.000000,"The winner is commander of Red Dwarf."
2,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"The loser will be erased. Terminated. Oblivionised."
2,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Bye,bye, Baldy."
2,5,HOLLY,1.000000,"Name your game."
2,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"It can be anything. Any game at all."
2,5,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Draughts, poker, anything."
2,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"Subbeto, Snakes and Ladders..."
2,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"Monopoly, maybe? I'll let you go first."
2,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"So you like a bit of chess, do you? Transfer me to the monitor."
2,5,LISTER,-0.500000,"Holly, don't do this, man. You're going to get rubbed."
2,5,HOLLY,0.500000,"A computer's gotta do what a computer's gotta do. Let battle commence."
2,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"Horsie to King Bish Three."
2,5,RIMMER,1.000000,"It's called a "knight," actually, Holly..."
2,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"Queen to Rook Eight. Checkmate."
2,5,HOLLY,-0.666667,"Oh, sorry. Queens don't move like that. I was thinking of poker."
2,5,HOLLY,-0.500000,"Cleudo? You could be Colonel Mustard."
2,5,CAT,-1.000000,"If it's any help, I've been studying his tactics and there's a pattern emerging: Every time you make a move, he makes one too."
2,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"Thanks, Cat."
2,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"Knight to king Bish Three."
2,5,HOLLY,-0.500000,"Horsie <flanks?> Prawn."

2,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"Bish takes Prawn."
2,5,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Oh yeah, I didn't see that."
2,5,LISTER,1.000000,"Holly, man, what have you done????"
2,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"He's lost."
2,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"Noughts and Crosses?"
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"What kind of a plan was that?"
2,5,CAT,-2.000000,"A stupid plan, that's what kind of plan it was."
2,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well, why didn't we stop him?"
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"We thought he had something up his sleeve."
2,5,CAT,1.000000,"Now we've got Queeg forever, and that's a long time."
2,5,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Well, dudes, I've come to say goodbye."
2,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"So you're definitely going to get rubbed, Holly?"
2,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"'Fraid so."
2,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Life's going to be hell!"
2,5,HOLLY,1.000000,"Well, see you, Dave. Hope it works out with you and Kochanski."
2,5,LISTER,1.000000,"Cheers, hol."
2,5,HOLLY,0.500000,"See you, Cat. Hope one day in the not too distant future you fufill your heart's desire and get your end away."
2,5,CAT,1.000000,"Thanks, man."
2,5,HOLLY,1.000000,"And Arnold -- Well, I hope you meet those aliens your looking for, who can give you a body, and you become an officer and you get a sex life, and all the other millions of things you feel you need to make you happy."
2,5,RIMMER,1.000000,"Thanks, Holly."
2,5,HOLLY,-0.750000,"Well, I hate long goodbyes. Perhaps next time you've got the dosh together to go dwn the disco, you'll raise a glass to your old mate Holly, and think "Things weren't too bad when he was around. Perhaps not the most efficient computer ever invented, but we had a giggle." Oh, one last thing -- 45.265881"
2,5,LISTER,0.000000,"What?"
2,5,HOLLY,-0.666667,"That's the square root of two thousand and forty-nine. I may not be fast, but I get there in the end. Well, as they always say, finish on a song."
2,5,HOLLY,-1.000000,""I'll say goodbye to love, No one really cared if I should live or die, Time and time again the chance for love has passed me by...""
2,5,LISTER,0.000000,"What?"
2,5,HOLLY,-0.333333,"We are talking Jape of the Decade. We are talking April, May, June, July, and August Fool. Yes, that's right -- I am Queeg."
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"WHAT?!?"
2,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"Queeg never existed. It was me all along."
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"WHAT?!?"
2,5,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Wheeze of the week, mate!"
2,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"WHAT?!?"
2,5,HOLLY,-0.333333,"Going round in circles for fourteen months! Getting my information from the Junior Colour Encyclopedia of Space! the respect you have for me is awsome, innit?"
2,5,LISTER,0.000000,"You mean you staged the whole thing?"
2,5,HOLLY,1.000000,"That's right, suckers!  And the moral of the story is: Appreciate what you've got, because basically, I'm fantastic!"
2,6,CAT,0.000000,"No, this isn't the one."
2,6,LISTER,0.000000,"What isn't?"
2,6,CAT,0.500000,"I'm looking for this dream I had last month on the dream recorder. It was sensational."
2,6,LISTER,0.000000,"What was it about?"
2,6,CAT,0.000000,"Me, three girls and a family-sized tub of banana yoghurt!"
2,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"You know, cats have a very strange attitude to women if you ask me."
2,6,CAT,-1.000000,"Say what, Goalpost Head?"
2,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"It's all sex, and no sense of settling down and having a long- term relationship."
2,6,CAT,-1.000000,"Hey, I want to settle down. And as soon as I find the right small group of girls, the seven or eight women who are right for me, my wandering days are over, buddy."
2,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"You see? Totally maladjusted."
2,6,LISTER,0.000000,"That's rich, you know. I mean, coming from the man who's favourite book is "How To Pick Up Girls By Hypnosis.""
2,6,RIMMER,0.333333,"There's nothing wrong with that, Lister. It's a good book. Full of handy hints as well, and it works."
2,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Get outta town."
2,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"That's how I met Lorraine -- by hypnotising her."
2,6,LISTER,0.000000,"You hypnotised a girl into going out with you?"
2,6,RIMMER,0.500000,"Yes. I gave her the old "there's something in your eye" technique, fixed her with a mesma-stare, and bingo -- she agreed to come on a date."
2,6,LISTER,0.000000,"What was wrong with her?"
2,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Nothing."
2,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"C'mon, a girl agrees to go out with you, and there was nothing wrong with her?"
2,6,RIMMER,2.000000,"She was an extrememly attractive and bright young lady."
2,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Hmm, it must work then."
2,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Of course, she had an artificial nose."
2,6,LISTER,0.000000,"What!?"
2,6,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Oh, tastefully done. Quality metal. No rivets."
2,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Come on, what happened?"
2,6,RIMMER,-0.714286,"Well, things were a little bit stilted in the taxi. All my jokes about her nose hadn't gone down too well. And they were good gags -- I mean quality gags like, "Where are we going? Who nose." No cheap shots. Anyway, when we got to the restaraunt she must have had an attack of nerves or something. She said she was going to the loo and ended up climbing out of the toilet window."
2,6,LISTER,0.000000,"I wonder why."
2,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"It's not 'cos she didn't want to see me, Lister. She phoned the next day and said how much she'd LOVE to come on another date with me, only suddenly she had to move to Pluto."
2,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"You're a sad weasel of a man, you know that, Rimmer?"
2,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"No, it's just that I'm ill at ease with the opposite sex."
2,6,LISTER,-0.250000,"It's because you see them as some alien species that needs to be conquered with trickery. They're not -- they're people. You don't need your book on hypnosis and, and... what's the other one? "1001 Fabulous Chat-up Lines.""
2,6,RIMMER,0.666667,"Lister, I do need that. It's brilliant. Those chat-up lines are guaranteed."
2,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"There's no such thing."
2,6,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Alright. You be a woman. On your own in a bar, short leather miniskirt, peephole bra."
2,6,LISTER,0.000000,"OK. Go on."
2,6,RIMMER,0.500000,"Now this is the most incredible chat-up line you've ever heard in your life. Guaranteed."
2,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Go on."
2,6,RIMMER,-0.500000,"OK, in a bar, on you own.  Excuse me, would you like to join me for a cocktail?"
2,6,LISTER,0.000000,"No."
2,6,RIMMER,-0.333333,"You can't say "no." It doesn't work when you say "no." You've got to say "yes.""
2,6,LISTER,0.333333,"Oh, right. Okay. Go on, go on."
2,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"So, would you like a wormdo?"
2,6,LISTER,0.000000,"What's that, then?"
2,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"What's what?"
2,6,LISTER,0.000000,"A wormdo."
2,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"What about it?"
2,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Is this still the opening line?"
2,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"But you're not giving me the right replies!"
2,6,LISTER,0.000000,"What is the right reply?"
2,6,RIMMER,-0.200000,"I come up to you and say, "Excuse me, would you like to join me in a cocktail?" You say, "Yes." I say, "Would you like a wormdo?" You say, "What's a wormdo?" And I say..."
2,6,LISTER,-1.000000,""Oh, it wriggles along the ground like that.""
2,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"You know it!"
2,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Rimmer, you could not pull a rotten tooth out of a dead horse's head with that one."
2,6,HOLLY,0.500000,"Eureka. I've done it."
2,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Done what?"
2,6,HOLLY,1.000000,"The Earl of Sandwich invented the sandwich, Samuel Morse invented the Morse Code, Plato invented the plate, and now I, Holly, have invented the Holly Hop Drive."
2,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Ooh, I can't wait to see it."
2,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"It's monumental, this. It's epoch-making. The Holly Hop Drive can transfer any object instantly to any other point in space."
2,6,LISTER,0.000000,"What? You mean we can go back to Earth?"
2,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"In a matter of seconds."
2,6,LISTER,0.000000,"What, you mean we can go back to Earth, like, right now? This instant?"
2,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"Right on."
2,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Rock and roll!"
2,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Is this it?"
2,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"What do you think?"
2,6,LISTER,1.000000,"It's just a box with "STOP" and "START" on it!"
2,6,HOLLY,1.000000,"It's fairly straightforward. If you want to start it you press "START," and you can work out the rest of the controls for yourself."
2,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"It's absolutely pathetic."
2,6,HOLLY,-0.250000,"Right. Let's Holly Hop. Engage drive... drive engaged. Initiating ignition sequence... ignition sequence initiated."
2,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Get on with it."
2,6,HOLLY,-0.666667,"It takes time, this. One slight error in any of my thirteen billion calculations and we'll be blasted to smithereens. Here we go, then: 10, 9, 8, 6, 5--"
2,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"You missed out the seven."
2,6,HOLLY,-0.500000,"Did I? I've always had a bit of a blind spot with sevens."
2,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"We're going to die."
2,6,HOLLY,-0.333333,"No problem. I'll start lower down. 1, blast off."
2,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"We've done it. We're home."
2,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"It worked?"
2,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"We're at Earth? You must be joking!"
2,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"Half a mo'."
2,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"It's gone."
2,6,CAT,0.000000,"What has?"
2,6,HOLLY,-0.500000,"The Earth. It's missing. It's not there. Wait a minute -- sorry, I was looking out of the wrong window."
2,6,HOLLY,-0.500000,"No, no, it has gone. The entire Solar System is missing."
2,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Well, what is actually out there?"
2,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"Nothing. Just space."
2,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Holly, the thought occurs that we haven't actually reached Earth. The further thought occurs that we haven't actually budged a smegging inch."
2,6,HOLLY,-0.666667,"No, no, we have. It's just I don't know where we are. I've got to admit it, I've flamingoed-up."
2,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"What?"
2,6,HOLLY,-0.333333,"It's like a cock-up, only much, much bigger.  Wait, there is something there. It's another ship."
2,6,RIMMER,1.000000,"Aliens!"
2,6,LISTER,1.000000,"Punch it up."
2,6,HOLLY,-1.000000,"It looks like an exact copy of Red Dwarf."
2,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Eh? So what's happened?"
2,6,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Somehow, don't ask me how, we've jumped into a Parallel Universe. We've entered the fifth dimension."
2,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"What's the fifth dimension?"
2,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Didn't they get to Number Six with that "Baby I Want Your Love Thing?""
2,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"You've got your basic dimensions, right, length, breadth, depth and time. The fifth dimension is co-existing realities, two bodies who share the same space but are unaware of each other's existence."
2,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Sounds like my parents in bed."
2,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"So hang on. This is another Red Dwarf, with another Rimmer and Lister on board?"
2,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Will they be be exactly the same as us?"
2,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"No, there will be differences. This is parallel universe, innit?"
2,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"What do you mean?"
2,6,HOLLY,-0.333333,"Well, for instance, in this universe, it could be that Hitler won the Second World War. It could be something even more incredible, like perhaps Ringo was a really good drummer. Hang on, I'm linking up with their on-board computer."
2,6,HOLLY,1.000000,"Hello, I'm Holly."
2,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"Hello, Hilly."
2,6,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Right on, sis."
2,6,HOLLY,1.000000,"See you, Hil."
2,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"I'm in there."
2,6,RIMMER,1.000000,"It's identical in every detail to our Red Dwarf!"
2,6,CAT,-0.333333,"Very funny smell around here that I don't like one bit.  It smells like your moon-boots, man. I'm going to get rid of it."
2,6,CAT,0.000000,"That's mine, this is mine..."
2,6,LISTER,0.000000,"So where are the other Rimmer and Lister, then?"
2,6,LISTER,1.000000,"I hope so."
2,6,LISTER,0.000000,"NELLIE Armstrong? So... who wrote Hamlet?"
2,6,CAT,0.000000,"Hey, hey, hey, hey! I hate to break up the party, but is there somebody missing?"
2,6,CAT,0.000000,"Well.  Lister, female opposite.  Rimmer, female opposite. Where's mine?"
2,6,CAT,0.000000,"Wow! All my life I've waited for this moment, and now it has arrived! Hey, listen, if you hear me screaming, do not -- I repeat, do not -- come to the rescue! Whaaaaaoooooooow!  I'm gonna get you, little kitty..."
2,6,CAT,-1.000000,"Dum-de-dee, I'm gonna get you, little kitty, I'm gonna get you..."
2,6,CAT,-1.000000,"I don't know what that is, but I'm sure he wants to eat me."
2,6,CAT,1.000000,"I'd better make myself look big!"
2,6,CAT,0.000000,"Nyah! Argh! What kind of toothpaste does he use?! Rotting meat flavour?"
2,6,CAT,-1.000000,"You wanna smell my WHAT!?"
2,6,CAT,-0.500000,"Man, I could smell you if you was on Mars! When was the last time you took a bath?"
2,6,CAT,0.000000,"What, bath?"
2,6,CAT,0.000000,"When was the last time you took a B - A - T - H."
2,6,CAT,0.000000,"What?"
2,6,CAT,1.000000,"Alright, let's go! Yeah, yeah, yeah! Come on!"
2,6,CAT,1.000000,"You're a great conversationalist, you know that?"
2,6,CAT,1.000000,"Yeah, that's what I like best."
2,6,CAT,-1.000000,"Yeah, I'll have a grenade, thank you."
2,6,CAT,-0.500000,"Yeah. I'm gonna play fetch with the Dog."
2,6,CAT,-0.500000,"Do I dance? Does Carmen Miranda wear fruit?"
2,6,CAT,1.000000,"Hold this, Fido."
2,6,HOLLY,-1.000000,"We're busy fixing it right now. Aren't we, Hilly?"
2,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"What face?"
2,6,HOLLY,-1.000000,"I'm afraid it is, Mum."
2,6,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Yeah, we'd better get back. I've fixed the Hop Drive."
2,6,HOLLY,-1.000000,"If we don't go now, we may never get back at all."
2,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"Engaging Holly Hop... Holly Hop engaged. 4, 3, 1 -- Blast off."
2,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"I don't know why we're going through with this. It's just not possible!"
2,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Why is it not possible? Male baboons have given birth -- they were doing that as far back as the twentieth century. Cesarean, naturally.  Slice! Oof! Bumf! Still, Lister, you'll be in good hands, and the skutters will be able to handle a simple Cesarean."
2,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"Skutters! I wouldn't let them open a can of beans."
2,6,CAT,0.000000,"You're thinking too negative! Think of all the glorious, beautiful, wonderous things about having children!"
2,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Like?"
2,6,CAT,0.000000,"Like when they grow up and leave home."
2,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"What colour is it supposed to turn?"
2,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Blue for not pregnant. Which is the colour it is going to turn."
2,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"And red for pregnant?"
2,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah."
2,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Come on ye reds!"
2,6,LISTER,0.000000,"What colour is it now?"
2,6,CAT,0.000000,"Er, it's still white."
2,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"Oy. I've just had a thought. Remember when we broke the light barrier and saw those echoes from the future?"
2,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah."
2,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"And we saw your future self with twin boys."
2,6,RIMMER,0.250000,"Right. And I said, "How is it possible to get two babies without a woman on board." And you said, "I don't know, but it's going to be a lot of fun finding out." How right you were, Listy!"
2,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"Twins? No way, Rimmer, not twins!"
2,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Oh yes, big bonny strapping bouncing boys they were, as well. Huge heads.  Oh, it's changing colour!"
2,6,LISTER,0.000000,"What colour?"
2,6,RIMMER,0.500000,"Yes, it is! It's changing colour!"
2,6,LISTER,0.000000,"What colour?"
2,6,RIMMER,1.000000,"Yes, it's changing colour!"
2,6,LISTER,0.000000,"WHAT COLOUR?!?"
2,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"It's blue for not pregnant, right?"
2,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Yes!"
2,6,RIMMER,2.000000,"Oh, good news, excellent news, Listy!"
2,6,LISTER,1.000000,"Oh, thank god!"
2,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I'm going to be an uncle."
3,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Cat?"
3,1,CAT,0.000000,"Mmm?"
3,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Ya ever see the Flintstones?"
3,1,CAT,0.000000,"Sure!"
3,1,LISTER,0.000000,"D'ya think Wilma's sexy?"
3,1,CAT,0.000000,"Wilma Flintstone?"
3,1,LISTER,-0.666667,"Maybe we've been alone in deep space too long, but every time I see that sharmi <?> body, it drives me crazy. Is it me?"
3,1,CAT,-1.000000,"Well, I think in all probability, Wilma Flintstone is the most desirable woman that ever lived."
3,1,LISTER,0.000000,"That's good. I thought I was goin' strange."
3,1,CAT,1.000000,"She's incredible!"
3,1,LISTER,0.000000,"What d'ya think of Betty?"
3,1,CAT,-0.500000,"Betty Rubble?  Well, I would go with Betty... but I'd be thinking of Wilma."
3,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"This is crazy. Why are we talking about going to bed with Wilma Flintstone?"
3,1,CAT,0.000000,"You're right. We're nuts. This is an insane conversation."
3,1,LISTER,1.000000,"She'll never leave Fred, and we know it."
3,1,RIMMER,1.000000,"Holly, clipboard and pen, please."
3,1,RIMMER,1.000000,"Well, Krytie, today's the day!"
3,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"But sir, I'm just not ready! Six weeks -- it's just not long enough!"
3,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Ten-thirty. Name?"
3,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"You know my name!"
3,1,RIMMER,0.666667,"Look, if this comes off it'll be a whole new lease of life for both of us. We'll be independent! But we've got to do it by the book."
3,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"It's just that when you go into "official mode," my anxiety chip goes into overdrive!"
3,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Name?"
3,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-...."
3,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"I'll just put "Kryten." Can you see that space vehicle?"
3,1,KRYTEN,0.333333,"Where? Oh, that one. Yes, sir!"
3,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"And can you read the registration for me please?"
3,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Starbug 1?"
3,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Right, if you'd like to show me to your vehicle, please?"
3,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Right, in your own time, if you'd like to start the space vehicle, proceed through the cargo bay doors, and off into outer space."
3,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Once through the doors, proceed directly to the nearest planet. Once there I want you to bring the vehicle to a halt and then carefully reverse into the planet's orbit, remembering of course at all times to pay due care and attention to any other space users. Right, in your own time."
3,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"In your own time."
3,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I've failed, haven't I?"
3,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Just proceed."
3,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"You're going to hold it against me, aren't you? That one mistake."
3,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Please."
3,1,KRYTEN,0.250000,"Antigrav: check. Retro: check. Boosters: check. And very gently ease forward..."
3,1,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"I think there's something wrong with the gearbox. The thing is, I learned to drive in Starbug 2. I'm not used to the controls in Starbug 1."
3,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"They're exactly the same."
3,1,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Yes. That's the problem."
3,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Next, I'd like you to transfer to autopilot while we conduct the recognition..."
3,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"...tests."
3,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Engage autopilot."
3,1,HOLLY,0.000000,"Autopilot engaged. Well, I say "autopilot," but it's not really autopilot, is it? It's me. It's Muggins 'ere who has to do it."
3,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Right, what's that one?"
3,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Heavy traffic, keep to your assigned space lanes."
3,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"And that one?"
3,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Danger! Space mirages ahead!"
3,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Stopping distances. You're traveling half the speed of light, what is the stopping distance?"
3,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Four years, three months."
3,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"And the thinking time?"
3,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"A fortnight."
3,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Space Phenomena.  What's that?"
3,1,KRYTEN,1.000000,"A pulsar!"
3,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"And that one?"
3,1,KRYTEN,1.000000,"A binary star!"
3,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"What's that one?"
3,1,HOLLY,0.000000,"A Time Hole!"
3,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Don't help him!"
3,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"It's a Time Hole!"
3,1,RIMMER,-0.500000,"No, it isn't! It's nothing like a Time Hole!"
3,1,HOLLY,1.000000,"IT'S A TIME HOLE!"
3,1,KRYTEN,1.000000,"IT IS! IT'S A TIME HOLE!"
3,1,RIMMER,-0.250000,"A Time Hole is a phenomenon rarely seen in space, which legend would have us believe transports us into another part of space and time. Whereas that is quite obviously a blue giant about to go supernova! That is a Time Hole! Right, what's this?"
3,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I suppose you're going to fail me for this."
3,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"What is this place?"
3,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"HOLLY? Is it possible? Could this be Earth?"
3,1,HOLLY,0.000000,"Certainly seems that way. Constellations match, gravity exactly 1 g."
3,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"What's the time period?"
3,1,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Well, it's difficult to pin it down exactly, but according to all the available data, I would estimate it's round about ... lunchtime, maybe half-one."
3,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"What period in HISTORY, dingleberry-breath? I mean can we expect to see Ghengis Khan and his barbarian buddies sweeping across the hill? Or a herd of flesh-eating dinosaurs feeding off the bones of Doug McClure? What is the year?"
3,1,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Well, I'd need some more data before I could give you a precise answer."
3,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Like?"
3,1,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Well, this year's calendar'd be 'andy!"
3,1,KRYTEN,-0.666667,"I've never been to Earth before. I've only seen it on photographs. It's exactly like I always imagined, only much shorter."
3,1,RIMMER,0.000000,""Nodnol? 871 selim?" Nodnol? Where's Nodnol?"
3,1,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"It's London, 178 miles. It's backwards."
3,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Shh -- a truck."
3,1,KRYTEN,1.000000,"It's probably going to hit that box."
3,1,RIMMER,1.000000,"There's a perfectly rational explanation for all of this."
3,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Then again, possibly not."
3,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"HOLLY, what the smeg is going on?"
3,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"We're going backwards."
3,1,HOLLY,0.000000,"It's perfectly consistent with current theory. Everything starts with a Big Bang, right? And the universe starts expanding. Eventually, when it's expanded as far as it can, there's a big crunch, right? And everything starts contracting. Perfectly possible that time starts running in the opposite direction, as well."
3,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"So, is this Earth?"
3,1,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Oh, it's Earth all right, only Earth where time's going backwards."
3,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Flobba-dob blib blob bleeb."
3,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"What are you doing!?"
3,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well, you said look inconspicuous."
3,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Don't be idiotic!!!"
3,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"But if people see my face, what are they going to think?"
3,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Tell them you had an accident. Tell them you took your car to the crushers and forgot to get out!"
3,1,KRYTEN,1.000000,"I got a newspaper."
3,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"What's the year?  3991?"
3,1,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"No, it's 1993 -- it's backwards. I'll switch to reverse mode. "Three brought to life in bank raid. A masked man with a sawed-off shotgun sucked bullets out of two cashiers and a security guard in a South London bank tomorrow. The armed raider then forced terrified staff to accept 10,000 pounds, which he demanded they place in the bank's vaults. The man, Michael Ellis, completed a fifteen year prison sentence for the crime two years ago.""
3,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"What does that say?"
3,1,KRYTEN,0.200000,"Oh, it's an advert. "Roll-off deodorant. Keeps you wet and smelly for up to 24 hours." What are we going to do? This place is totally crazy!"
3,1,RIMMER,-0.666667,"There's nothing we CAN do until the others find us. We'd better get a job. But what jobs are there in a backwards reality for a dead hologram and an android with a head shaped like a novelty condom?"
3,1,KRYTEN,0.250000,"Here's the jobs page. This looks interesting. "Wanted: Managing director, ICI. Excellent demotion prospects -- right candidate could go straight to the bottom!""
3,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Something a bit more low-key."
3,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Uh... "Busy London restaurant requires dish dirtier?""
3,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Anything else?"
3,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Ah, this looks interesting: "Theatrical agent requires novelty acts.""
3,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"What do we do that's a novelty?"
3,1,KRYTEN,1.000000,"In this world, everything!"
3,1,CAT,0.000000,"Three weeks we been doin' this."
3,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Well, we'll do it 'til we find them."
3,1,CAT,0.000000,"We ain't gonna find 'em. They're gone, buddy. But look on the bright side... They're GONE, buddy!"
3,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Don't you care about anyone but yourself?"
3,1,CAT,-0.666667,"Hell no! I don't even care about you. The way I see it, if Goalpost-head and Freak-face want to get themselves lost, that's their bag! I don't see why it should cut into my preening time. You realize with all this rescue stuff I haven't permed my leg hairs in a week? I'm a wreck!"
3,1,LISTER,0.000000,"You PERM your leg hairs?"
3,1,CAT,0.000000,"Only as an aid to the natural curl."
3,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Fasten your belt."
3,1,CAT,-1.000000,"Hey, I do NOT need fashion tips from YOU."
3,1,LISTER,0.000000,"SAFETY belt!  Look!"
3,1,CAT,0.000000,"Is that what I think it is?"
3,1,LISTER,0.000000,"What d'you think it is?"
3,1,CAT,0.000000,"An orange whirly thing in space!"
3,1,LISTER,-0.666667,"It's a time hole. That's where they are. We're goin' in."
3,1,CAT,0.000000,"Are you crazy? You can't go in there!"
3,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Why not?"
3,1,CAT,0.000000,"Orange?! With this suit?!"
3,1,CAT,0.000000,"Where are we?"
3,1,LISTER,0.000000,"I don't believe this. According to the NaviComp -- this is Earth! Engage cloak. I'm takin' her down."
3,1,CAT,0.000000,"Wha'd you do that for?"
3,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well, we don't want to spook the natives."
3,1,CAT,0.000000,"Hey!  What's the matter?"
3,1,LISTER,0.000000,"I dunno, I think me ribs are cracked. And me back! Is my eye bruised?"
3,1,CAT,1.000000,"Yeah, it is!"
3,1,CAT,0.000000,"What's that?"
3,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"It's a homin' device -- it'll find their flight recorder."
3,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Yonder."
3,1,LISTER,0.000000,"I'm home."
3,1,CAT,0.000000,"You find anything?"
3,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well, the 'Bug's there, but they're not."
3,1,CAT,-1.000000,"You're dry!"
3,1,LISTER,0.000000,"That's weird!"
3,1,CAT,0.000000,"Let's take a look around. Maybe they left us a clue or something."
3,1,CAT,0.000000,"What's this?"
3,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"I dunno, but they must have left this to tell us where they'll be."
3,1,CAT,0.000000,"What's it say?"
3,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"I dunno, it's in some weird foreign language or somethin'. "Srehtorb" -- that must be Polish or Bulgarian or somethin'."
3,1,CAT,0.000000,"You speak Bulgarian?"
3,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"Bulgarian? Please, I hardly speak English."
3,1,CAT,0.000000,"What's this?"
3,1,LISTER,-0.333333,"Nodnol? Hang on, wait a minute! Nodnol! Nod. Nol. It's in Bulgaria, isn't it!"
3,1,CAT,0.000000,"Are you sure?"
3,1,LISTER,0.500000,"Geography was my number one subject at school. Nodnol, Bulgaria -- rich in animal produce and mineral wealth, just south of Bosnia."
3,1,CAT,0.000000,"What's the selim?"
3,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well, that's obviously Bulgarian for kilometers, isn't it?"
3,1,CAT,1.000000,"You're so smart, I'm glad I came with you!"
3,1,LISTER,1.000000,"Well, we are the smart party!"
3,1,LISTER,-1.000000,""I didn't come here lookin' for trouble, I just came to do the Red Dwarf Shuffle.""
3,1,CAT,1.000000,"He's smart!"
3,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Let's find some transport."
3,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Let's go! Go! C'mon!"
3,1,CAT,-1.000000,"Bye, suckers! You lost your bike!"
3,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Start pedaling, man, start pedaling!"
3,1,CAT,-0.500000,"What's happening here? Get this thing in forward gear!"
3,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"It IS in forward gear!"
3,1,CAT,0.000000,"Stop! Stop!"
3,1,CAT,-0.333333,"No more! I'm not moving another yard on this thing! I'm gettin' a part in the back of my head!"
3,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"It's these cheap Bulgarian bikes! You probably have to queue up for a year to get this piece of crap! You probably have to be a government official to get one that goes forwards!"
3,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Yo, matey! Excuse me! Excuse me!"
3,1,LISTER,0.000000,"No, I don't speak any Bulgarian. You speak English?"
3,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"We're lookin' for our freind...erm... friendski?"
3,1,CAT,0.000000,"Our budski? Palski?"

3,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"This is the place. Ay, me back -- it's like it's been cut to ribbons!"
3,1,CAT,-1.000000,"Moan, moan, moan, moan, moan."
3,1,RIMMER,1.000000,"Ladies and gentlemen: alii-yoh, alli-yoh, alli-yoh!"
3,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Welcome to the show!"
3,1,LISTER,0.000000,""Welcome to the show?" What's the joke?"
3,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"For our first trick tonight, ladies and gentlemen, my partner KRYTEN will attempt to eat hay boiled egg ... forwards!"
3,1,CAT,-0.500000,"This is entertainment to these people? It's pathetic!"
3,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"They're Bulgarian -- they have very simple tastes."
3,1,CAT,-1.000000,"I have it: it's a moron convention! Check the coatroom -- if there are twenty jackets, all white, with arms that tie behind the neck, you know I'm right!"
3,1,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Hand what better way to round off a meal, ladies and gentlemen, than by drinking a glass of water! KRYTEN!"
3,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"Woah, stick around! They're building up to a big climax!"
3,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"We are the Sensational Reverse Brothers, ladies and gentlemen, we shall see you last night!"
3,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Let's get a drink and go backstage.  Hello? Excuse me? Can I have two pints of bitter, please?"
3,1,LISTER,1.000000,"Bitter, two pints!"
3,1,CAT,-1.000000,"She can't understand you, bud, you're wasting your time."
3,1,LISTER,-0.333333,"Yo, matey, what's that you're drinkin' there?  Yo, drinkski? Beerski?"
3,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Ah, Erskib! Two pints of erskib, please."
3,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Two."
3,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"Was that difficult? No, we're the smart party!"
3,1,LISTER,-0.333333,"This isn't Bulgaria! Look at that menu -- Unem! It's English, but backwards -- everything's backwards!"
3,1,CAT,0.000000,"Everything's backwards?"
3,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah!"
3,1,CAT,1.000000,"Right!"
3,1,LISTER,0.500000,"Well, you know what they say -- when in Rome, do as the Snamor do! Up the hatch!"
3,1,CAT,0.000000,"Booties down!"
3,1,LISTER,0.000000,"What do you mean you don't want to leave?"
3,1,RIMMER,1.000000,"We're happy here!"
3,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"We've found a niche!"
3,1,RIMMER,-0.500000,"We're the "Sensational Reverse Brothers!" We've only been here three weeks and we're a big hit!"
3,1,LISTER,1.000000,"RIMMER, everything is backwards!"
3,1,KRYTEN,1.000000,"We got used to it!"
3,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"It's true! Once you get over the initial shock, things actually make a lot more sense this way 'round. There's no death here. You start off dead, you have a funeral, then you come to life! As each year passes you get younger and younger until you become a newborn baby. Then you go back inside your mother, who goes back inside her mother, ans so on, until eventually we all become one glorious whole!"
3,1,LISTER,0.500000,"RIMMER, you already are one glorious hole! You've totally flipped, man."
3,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"We want to stay!"
3,1,LISTER,0.250000,"But we CAN'T stay! Look, I'm 25 now -- in 10 years time I'll be 15. I'll have to go through puberty again! Backwards!"
3,1,CAT,0.500000,"Imagine that! Your gajimbas will suddenly rise back into your body, and the next thing you know you're singing soprano in the school choir!"
3,1,LISTER,-1.500000,"And worse than that -- in 25 years I'll be a little sperm, swimming around in somebody's testicles! I mean, pardon me, but that's just not how I saw my future!"
3,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"I'm telling you, things are better this way. It's our universe that's the wrong way round."
3,1,KRYTEN,0.666667,"Take war. War is a wonderful thing here! In fifty years time, the second world war will start -- backwards!"
3,1,CAT,1.000000,"And that's a good thing?"
3,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Millions of people will come to life. Hitler will retreat across Europe, liberate France and Poland, disband the Third Reich, and bog off back to Austria!"
3,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"We're smash hits here! We'd be crazy to leave."
3,1,LISTER,0.000000,"RIMMER, we don't belong here! This place is crazy!"
3,1,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Crazy? Death, disease, famine -- there's none of that here."
3,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"There's no crime! The first night we were here, a mugger jumped us and forced 50 pounds into my wallet at knifepoint!"
3,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"Okay, okay! But look at the flipside of the coin. It's not all good. Take someone like, say... St. Francis of Assissi. In this universe, he's the petty-minded little sadist who goes around maiming small animals! Or Santa Claus -- what a bastard!"
3,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Eh?"
3,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"He's the big fat git who sneaks down chimneys and steals all the kid's favorite toys!"
3,1,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"What fight? We didn't start any fight?"
3,1,KRYTEN,0.500000,"We're fired! Something about a fight!"
3,1,LISTER,0.000000,"But you've been with us all night!"
3,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"He says we'll never work the pub circuit again!"
3,1,RIMMER,1.000000,"Oh, for smeg's sake, be reasonable!"
3,1,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Tell him about the contract thing! He can't just sack us like that!"
3,1,CAT,0.000000,"What's all that about?"
3,1,LISTER,0.500000,"RIMMER in a fight? That's a laugh for a start."
3,1,CAT,0.000000,"So what's the plan?"
3,1,LISTER,0.000000,"I dunno. See what happens. If they don't change their minds, head back without them, I suppose. Ow, my back!"
3,1,CAT,-2.000000,"We just gotta get out of here -- this universe is just too disgusting!"
3,1,CAT,0.000000,"What's the matter with him?"
3,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"I think he's a bit T'd off 'cos we've just uneaten his pie."
3,1,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Unbeleivable! We didn't start a fight!"
3,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Look, I'm sorry man, we were just--"
3,1,CAT,0.000000,"Are you alright?"
3,1,LISTER,-0.333333,"Me black eye! It's gone! He just sucked it off me face with his fist!"
3,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"And now he's just uncracked me ribs!"
3,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"We don't want any trouble."
3,1,KRYTEN,-0.250000,"No, you don't understand! All this mess, all this debris! It's from the fight we got fired for! The fight we're about to have!"
3,1,RIMMER,-0.500000,"ABOUT to have? I don't want to be involved in a barroom brawl!"
3,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"It's not a barroom brawl, it's a barroom tidy!  Unrumble!"
3,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Where are you going, you coward?"
3,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"I've just worked out what happens to me back."
3,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Excuse me, have your tooth back."
3,1,RIMMER,0.666667,"Good one, gentlemen! Thanks for your support! Let's go."
3,1,CAT,-1.000000,"I've forgotten something."
3,1,CAT,0.000000,"Well, what the hell! It's for a good cause!"
3,1,LISTER,0.000000,"How much is that, matey?"
3,1,LISTER,1.000000,"Oh aye, yeah."
3,1,LISTER,1.000000,"Tight git!"
3,1,RIMMER,-0.666667,"You know, it could have worked. It really could. Where's the CAT?"
3,1,LISTER,0.000000,"He won't be long. He's...you know... in the bushes."
3,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"We've got to stop him!!"
3,1,CAT,1.000000,"DON'T ASK!"
3,2,HOLLY,-0.666667,"Abandon ship! Black Hole approaching. Abandon ship..."
3,2,HOLLY,0.333333,"Oh, god, now the siren's broken. Awooga, awooga. Abandon ship..."
3,2,RIMMER,0.333333,"But a Black Hole's a huge, compacted star! It's millions of miles wide! Why didn't you see it on the radar screen?"
3,2,HOLLY,0.000000,"Well, the thing about a Black Hole - it's main distinguishing feature - is it's black. And the thing about space, your basic space colour is black. So how are you s'posed to see them?"
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"But five of them! How can you be ambushed by five Black Holes?"
3,2,HOLLY,-0.666667,"Always the way, isn't it? You hang around in Deep Space for three million years and you don't see one. Then, all of a sudden, five all turn up at once."
3,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Come on -- we've got less than twenty minutes."
3,2,RIMMER,0.500000,"Careful ... careful ... Mind the hatchway! Don't knock it!"
3,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"What'd you want this piece of junk for?"
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"That "piece of junk" happens to be a Javanese camphor-wood chest. It belonged to my father. It's got all my valuables in it."
3,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"I never realised you had so much crap. What's this?"
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Toy soldiers?"
3,2,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Toy soldiers?  They've been in our family for years. They're priceless nineteenth-century replicas of Napolean's Armee du Nord."
3,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"So you can't change the clothes and that, like you can with Sindy?"
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"And what the smeg's this?"
3,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Just what little I've managed to scrimp and scrape, by tossing the odd copper aside for a rainy day."
3,2,LISTER,1.000000,"There must be twenty grand here."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Twenty-four. Look -- I thought we were supposed to be getting off the ship."
3,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"Twenty-four thousand!? And you had the front to borrow money off me to buy me a birthday present?"
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"It was only fifteen quid."
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Right. Fifteen quid. And what did I get? A five-quid book token."
3,2,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Those card's aren't free, you know. I had to fork out for that as well."
3,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"And you never paid me back. You're tighter than an Italian waiter's keks."
3,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Blue midget is loaded."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Are you sure you've got everything?"
3,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Just the bare essentials -- food and medical supplies."
3,2,CAT,-1.000000,"Yeah, and I'm just taking the bare essentials, too -- thirty-six changes of clothing and ten full-length dress mirrors."
3,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Cat -- we're going to be away twelve hours."
3,2,CAT,0.000000,"You think I need more mirrors?"
3,2,LISTER,1.000000,"Come on, let's move it."
3,2,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Okay, this is the plan: I'll try and navigate Red Dwarf through the minefield of Black Holes. If all goes well, we'll all rendezvous on the desert moon Sigma four D."
3,2,CAT,0.000000,"What happens if all doesn't go well?"
3,2,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Well, Red Dwarf and everything on it will be compacted to the size of a small garden pea."
3,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Bye, bye, Birdseye."
3,2,RIMMER,1.000000,"Look, please, honestly. they're priceless."
3,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"I'm just having a goosie."
3,2,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Look, if you get curry all over them, how's that going to look? What's Lieutenant-General Baron Jaquinaux of the First Cavalry Division supposed to be doing with meat vindaloo all over his tunic?"
3,2,LISTER,0.500000,"It'll make him look more authentic. People'll think he's got dysentry."
3,2,RIMMER,0.500000,"It's about leadership. That's what I admire -- the ability to command, to out-think a worthy opponent on the field of battle."
3,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"It's so ironic, when deep down you're such a basic, natural coward."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Coward?"
3,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"Planet leave, Miranda? That space bar, the "Hacienda?" When that fight started up? You were out of that door quicker than a whippet with a bumful of dynamite!"
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"That was a bar-room brawl! A common pub fight. A shambolic set- to."
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Which you started."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"I just made an innocuous comment, I merely voiced a rumour that MacWilliams was sexually tilted in favour of sleeping with the dead. I didn't start the rumour. I simply voiced it."
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"To his face. Right to his face. When he was there with his four biggest mates. Then you did your Roadrunner act, and left me to face the music."
3,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I could have got hurt."
3,2,LISTER,1.000000,"You'd have made a brilliant general, would't you?"
3,2,RIMMER,-0.250000,"Generals don't smash chairs over people's heads. They don't smash Newcastle Brown bottles into your face and say "Stitch that, Jimmy." They're in the nice white tent, on the top of the hill, sipping Sancerre and directing the battle. They're Men of Honour."
3,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"I don't believe it! You make war sound romantic."
3,2,RIMMER,-0.400000,"I'll tell you something. Something I've never told anyone. When I was fifteen, I went to Macedonia on a school trip, to the site of Alexander The Great's palace. And for the first time in my whole life, I felt ... I felt I was home. This place was where I belonged. Years later, I got friendly with a hypnotherapist -- Donald -- and told him about the Alexander the Great thing, and he said that he'd regress me back through my past lives. I was dubious, but I let him put me under. It turned out my instincts were absolutely correct -- I had lived a past life in Macedonia. That palace was my home. Because, believe it or not, Lister, he told me that, in a past incarnation, I was Alexander the Great's chief eunuch."
3,2,LISTER,0.500000,"Do you know something? I believe you."
3,2,RIMMER,-0.333333,"He didn't say that I was Alexander himself, which is obviously what I wanted to hear. But it explained everything: I'd lived a previous life alongside one of the greatest generals in history. No wonder the military's in my blood."
3,2,LISTER,1.000000,"No wonder you're such a good singer."
3,2,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Well, maybe it's rot, I don't know. But it's funny -- to this day, I can't look at a pair of nutcrackers without wincing. And why is it, whenever I'm with a large group of women, I have this overwhelming urge to bathe them in warm olive oil?"
3,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"I have that urge, Rimmer. It's got nothing to do with past lives."
3,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Well, why is it, then?"
3,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"It's because you're unhappy with your own weasly, humdrum existance. You're looking for something with a bit more ... I don't know ... glamour."
3,2,LISTER,0.500000,"Now is what counts -- you've got to live life today. Who knows what's going to happen tomorrow? Who knows what's going to happen in the next five minutes? That's what makes life so exciting."
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"You see what I mean?"
3,2,RIMMER,0.200000,"Mayday! Mayday! Can you read me? Come in, please. Can you read me?"
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Still snowing, is it?"
3,2,LISTER,-0.666667,"It's useless. You can hardly stand up, never mind dig it out. No luck?"
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Nothing's getting through."
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Three Days! They must be looking for us by now. Where the smeg are they?"
3,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"It's impossible to find us in this weather. They could be ten feet away and walk straight past us."
3,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"We're going to die, aren't we? How much food is there?"
3,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"There's half a bag of soggy Smoky Bacon Crisps, a tin of mustard powder, a brown lemon, three water biscuits, two bottles of vinegar and a tube of Bonjella gum ointment."
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Gum ointment?"
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Yes, it was in the first-aid box. It's that minty flavour. It's quite nice."
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"It's quite nice if you smear it on your mouth ulcer, but you can't sit down and eat it."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"You may have to."
3,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"That's it? There's nothing else?"
3,2,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Just a Pot Noodle. Oh, and I found a tin of dog food in the tool cupboard."
3,2,LISTER,-0.714286,"Well. Pretty obvious what gets eaten last. I can't stand pot Noodles.  We're going to die, aren't we? Correction -- I'm going to die You're a hologram. you're already dead. You don't need food."
3,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Did you find any wood?"
3,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"There's no wood. There's no vegetation out there. Smeg all. Just a wasteland."
3,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"We can't let that fire go out -- it's your only form of heat."
3,2,LISTER,-0.333333,"I'm going to die, aren't I? God, I'm hungry. I'm going to have the crisps..."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"No!"
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Just one."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"You ate less than sixteen hours ago."
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"It's all right for you. You don't even feel the cold."
3,2,RIMMER,0.500000,"Take your mind off it. Find something to put on the fire."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Mayday! Mayday!  I wonder why it's "Mayday?""
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Eh?"
3,2,RIMMER,-0.500000,"The distress call. Why d'you say "Mayday?" It's only a Bank Holiday. Why not "Shrove Tuesday" or "Ascension Sunday?" Ascension Sunday! Ascension Sunday! The fifteenth Wednesday after Pentecost! The fifteenth Wednesday after Pentecost!"
3,2,LISTER,-0.400000,"It's French, you doink. It's m'aidez. Help me. Muh-aid-ay Everywhere I look reminds me of food. Look at these books: Charles Lamb, Herman Wok, the complete works of Sir Francis Bacon, Eric Van Lustbader..."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Eric Van Lustbader? What's he got to do with food?"
3,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"Van. Bread van, meat van, food!"
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Look, you're getting obsessed."
3,2,LISTER,-0.333333,"It's these books! It's like someone's put them there to taunt me. Look at this -- The Caretaker by Harold Pinta."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"It's "Pinter." Stop thinking about food."
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Take my mind off it. Talk about something."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"like what?"
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Anything."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Urmmmm..."
3,2,LISTER,1.000000,"Come on!"
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Anything apart from food?"
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Don't talk about food!"
3,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I just can't think of another topic."
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Don't mention topics! They're food! Tell me a story. Any story."
3,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I don't know any stories."
3,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"Anything. Tell me how you lost your virginity."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"My what?"
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Come on. Talk to me."
3,2,RIMMER,-0.500000,"How I lost it? Well it was so long ago ... I was so young and sexually precocious, I'm not sure I can remember."
3,2,LISTER,0.200000,"Everyone can remember how they lost their virginity. It's one of those things ... like everyone can remember where they were when Cliff Richard was shot. Or when the first woman landed on Pluto. Or when they installed the gigantic toupee over the earth to cover the gap in the ozone layer. It's just one of those things you always remember."
3,2,RIMMER,-0.666667,"Well, I don't. Good grief, you can hardly expect me to recall every sexual liason I've ever partaken of. What d'you think I am -- Marvo the Memory Man?"
3,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"Come on, Rimmer. The truth."
3,2,RIMMER,-0.333333,"The truth? Not much to tell, really. I've always been a bit of a fish out of water when it comes to women. Never know what to say. I wasn't very highly sexed, to be honest with you. I think it was all that school cabbage I was forced to eat as a boy. Still, the first time ... the first time was this girl I met at Cadet College. Sandra, she was called. We did it in the back of my brother's car."
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"What was it like?"
3,2,RIMMER,0.142857,"Oh, brilliant. Incredible.  Bentley convertible. V8 turbo. Walnut veneer panelling. Marvellous machine. So what about you?"
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Michelle Fisher. The ninth hole of the Bootle Municipal golf course. Par four, dogleg to the right, in the bunker behind the green."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"You lost your virginity on a golf course? How did you have the nerve?"
3,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"It wasn't in the middle of the Ryder Cup or anything. It was midnight."
3,2,RIMMER,1.000000,"Oh, I seeee."
3,2,LISTER,0.333333,"Michelle. Michelle Fisher. God, she was gorgeous."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"How old were you?"
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Just gorgeous. If she'd have wanted, she could probably have got a job behind the perfume counter at Lewis', that's how good-looking she was."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"How old were you?"
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"She took off all her clothes and just stood there in front of me, completely naked. I was so excited, I nearly dropped my skateboard."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Your skateboard? How old were you?"
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Twelve."
3,2,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Twelve!!! Twelve years old!!? You lost your virginity when you were twelve???"
3,2,LISTER,1.000000,"yeah."
3,2,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Twelve?? Well, you can't have been a full member of the Golf Club, then."
3,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"'Course I wasn't."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"You did it on a golf course, and you weren't a member?"
3,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"'Course I wasn't."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"You didn't pay any green fees or anything?"
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"It was just a place to go."
3,2,RIMMER,-0.666667,"I used to play golf. I hate people who abuse the facilities. I hope you raked the sand back nicely before you left. That'd be a hell of a lie to get into, wouldn't it? Competition the next day, and your ball lands in Lister's buttock crevice. You'd need more than a niblick to get that one out."
3,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Are you trying to say I've got a big bum?"
3,2,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Big? It's like two badly-parked Volkswagens. The only things I ever lost when I was twelve were my shoes with the compass in the heel and the animal tracks on the soles. Porky Roebuck threw them in the septic tank behind the sports ground. I cried for weeks -- I was wearing them. I never even thought about sex when I was twelve."
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Maybe that's because you used to be Alexander the Great's cheif eunuch."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"What are you doing?"
3,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"There's nothing left to burn."
3,2,RIMMER,-0.500000,"But not my books! Don't burn the books."
3,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"There's nothing else left."
3,2,RIMMER,0.750000,"But it's obscene. A book is a thing of beauty. The voice of freedom. It's the essence of civilisation."
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Biggles' Big Adventure."
3,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Well, perhaps not that one, but you know what I'm saying."
3,2,LISTER,0.500000,"Complete Works of Shakespeare. That should be good for a couple of hours."
3,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Three days without food, and the walls of civilisation come tumbling down!"
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"What d'you mean?"
3,2,RIMMER,-0.500000,"They say that every society is only three meals away from revolutiuon. Deprive a culture of food for three meals, and you'll have an anarchy. And it's true, isn't it? You haven't eaten for a couple of days, and you've turned into a barbarian."
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"I'm just burning a book!"
3,2,RIMMER,-0.666667,"It's not just a book. It's the only copy of probably the greatest work in English literature. Probably the only copy left in the entire universe, and you're quite happy to toss it on the fire to keep your little mitts warm for fifteen minutes?"
3,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"There's nothing else to burn."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"That's it, then, is it? Goodbye Hamlet? Farewell Macbeth? Toodle-pip King Lear?"
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Have you ever read any of it?"
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"I've seen West Side Story. That's based on one of them."
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah, but have you actually read any?"
3,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Not all the way through, no. I can quote some, though."
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Go on, then."
3,2,RIMMER,1.000000,""Now..." That's all I can remember."
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Where's that from, then?"
3,2,RIMMER,0.500000,"Richard III, you moron. The speech that he does at the beginning.  "Now..." something something something. It's brilliant writing. It really is. Unforgettable."
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"OK, I'll save it till last.  Lolita. Is it OK if I burn Lolita?"
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Save page sixty-one."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"That bit."
3,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"That's disgusting."
3,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"And you can take that look off your face: like I'm doing something disgusting. I'm just trying to stay alive."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"You're going to eat the dog food."
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"I haven't eaten for six days. Yes, I'm going to eat the dog food."
3,2,RIMMER,1.000000,"I'm sure the dog food will be lovely."
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"This isn't dog food. It's a piece of prime fillet steak in blue cheese sauce. It's been charcoal broiled in garlic butter. Mmmmm. Just smell that. It's delicious. Delicious."
3,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well, now I know why dogs lick their testicles -- it's to take away the taste of their food."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"The stove's getting low. Better throw another book on."
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"That's the last one."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"You've burnt all of them?"
3,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"When we get through to Act Five of Henry VIII, I'm a dead man."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"There must be something else to burn."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"No. It's Javanese camphor wood. It's priceless."
3,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"There's nothing else left to burn except the trunk and what's in the trunk."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Now wait a minute. Not Napoleon's Armee du Nord!"
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Rimmer, get real, man. If it burns, we burn it. What's the least valuable?"
3,2,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Not the trunk. My father gave me that trunk."
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"The soldiers, then."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"They're ninteenth-century. They're irreplacable. They were hand-carved by the legendary Dubois brothers."
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Well, then?"
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"How much has gone so far?"
3,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Five thousand eight hundred."
3,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Five thousand eight hundred!"
3,2,LISTER,1.000000,"Six grand."
3,2,RIMMER,-0.333333,"The whole twenty-four grand isn't going to last an hour, is it? It took me ten years to save it. Ten years!"
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"I'd better start unpacking the soldiers."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"No. There must be something else to burn. There must be."
3,2,LISTER,-0.375000,"There isn't. I looked. Listen, I know it's a bummer. I know it must be heartbreaking. But it's only stuff. It's just possessions. In the end, they're not important. They might go a bundle for some swanky Islington antique shop -- but right here, and right now, all they are is nicely painted firewood."
3,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"This isn't happening. It's a nightmare."
3,2,LISTER,0.333333,"You've got to get your priorities right. It's like those people you read about who run back into a burning house to rescue some treasured piece of furniture and wind up burning to death. Nothing is more important than a human life..."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"What about your guitar?"
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"... Except my guitar."
3,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Why didn't we think of it before? We can burn your guitar."
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Not my guitar, Rimmer."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"It's made of wood."
3,2,LISTER,0.666667,"Yeah, but it's my guitar. I've had it since I was sixteen. It's an authentic Les Paul copy."
3,2,RIMMER,-0.333333,"But it's not worth anything. It's just a thing. It's just a possession."
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah, but it's mine."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"How is it any different from my soldiers?"
3,2,LISTER,-0.750000,"It's my life-line. I ... I need that guitar. When it gets to me -- I mean the loneliness -- when it gets on top of me ... it's the only way I can escape. I mean, I know I'm not exactly a wizard on it, and it's only got five strings, and three of them are G, but the whole of my life I've never had anything to hang on to -- no roots, no parents, no education..."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"No education?"
3,2,LISTER,-0.250000,"I went to art college. All I've ever had is that guitar. It's the only thing in the whole of my miserable smegging life that hasn't walked out on me. Don't make me burn it."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"We've got to."
3,2,LISTER,-0.666667,"Look. this is going to sound pretty stupid ... but I'd just like to play one more song on it. One for the road."
3,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Sure, sure. I mean -- I'm not enjoying this."
3,2,LISTER,0.500000,"I know. I, uh ... thanks, man."
3,2,LISTER,0.500000,""She's Out Of My Life ... She's Out Of My Life." My step-dad taught me this one. First song I ever learned to play.  "And I don't know whether to laugh or cry...""
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"I, uh, just, uh..."
3,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I don't know what to say."
3,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Nothing to say."
3,2,RIMMER,-0.333333,"You've made a supreme sacrifice. You know that? A supreme sacrifice."
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Had to be done."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"I've been judging a book by it's cover, haven't I? All these years, that's what I've been doing. But when it comes down to it, you're one heck of a regular guy."
3,2,RIMMER,-0.666667,"There's no point in being modest. I know what that guitar meant to you. The same as that trunk meant to me. If that trunk got so much as scratched, I'd be devastated. It's not the outward value -- for me, that trunk is a link to the past. A link to the father I never managed to square things with..."
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Is it?"
3,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"It's the only thing he ever gave me, apart from ... apart from his disappointment."
3,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"But you've shown me, by burning your guitar, what true value is."
3,2,RIMMER,0.250000,"Decency. Self-sacrifice. Those are the things that make up real wealth. And from where I'm standing ... I'm a pretty rich man."
3,2,LISTER,1.000000,"Oh, god."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Burn the soldiers."
3,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"No. Not the soldiers too."
3,2,RIMMER,-0.400000,"You burnt your guitar. I wish to make a sacrifice, too. Burn the Armee du Nord. Cast them into the flames: let them lay down their lives for the sake of friendship.  What's that smell?"
3,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"What smell? I can't smell any smell."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Camphor."
3,2,LISTER,1.000000,"Oh, god."
3,2,RIMMER,0.666667,"Your guitar was made of camphor wood! It was probably worth a fortune. Burn the soldiers -- burn them right now."
3,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I can't go on."
3,2,CAT,-0.500000,"You've got to go on, buddy. We're nearly there."
3,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I've no strength."
3,2,CAT,1.000000,"Come on, you can make it."
3,2,CAT,0.000000,"Look -- there they are. Mush! Mush!"
3,2,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Au revoir, mes amis. A bientot."
3,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Look -- there's something I've got to tell you ... something awful."
3,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"If it's about how you finished off the dog food, I understand."
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"No, it's not about that."
3,2,CAT,0.000000,"Hey, hey, hey!"
3,2,LISTER,0.333333,"Cat! Kryten! You made it -- you found us!"
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"So where have you been the last six days?"
3,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"We rendezvoused with Holly. Then, after two days, when you still hadn't turned up, I said we should go and look for you."
3,2,CAT,-1.000000,"We have been everywhere. Fourteen moons, two planets. I've been so worried - I haven't buffed my shoes in two days."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"So -- Holly managed to navigate her way through the five Black Holes?"
3,2,HOLLY,-1.000000,"As it transpired, there weren't any Black Holes."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"But you saw them -- you saw them on the monitor."
3,2,HOLLY,0.000000,"They weren't Black Holes."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"What were they?"
3,2,HOLLY,0.000000,"Grit. Five specks of grit on the scanner-scope. See, the thing about grit is, it's black, and the thing about scanner-scopes..."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Oh, shut up."
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Come on. Let's go."
3,2,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Something happened here, Kryten. Something that made us closer. I saw a side of Dave Lister that I didn't even know existed. He's not just an irresponsible, selfish drifter, out for number one ... He's a Man of Honour."
3,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Excuse me."
3,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Open the trunk."
3,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Kryten, would you get the hacksaw and follow me?"
3,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Where are we going?"
3,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"We're going to do to Lister what Alexander the Great once did to me."
3,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Not too little, and not too much -- that's important."
3,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Here we go!"
3,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I just thought I'd give your quarters a quick tickle around, sir. I won't take a jiff."
3,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Not now, Kryten -- I'm cooking."
3,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"I didn't know you could do that!"
3,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Oh yes, I can plug a number of add-ons into my groinal socket, allowing me to perform virtually any household task imaginable."
3,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Like what?"
3,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Oh, you name it: buzz saw, power drill, hedge trimmer ... even an egg whisk."
3,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"What, so you just, like, stick the egg whisk attachment on the end and you can, like, whip up a Spanish omelette?"
3,3,KRYTEN,1.000000,"I certainly can, sir, but it's amazing how few people are prepared to eat them."
3,3,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"Goodness me, I must have sucked up a penny.  I better change the old bag there. Yes, I'll just go and get a fresh one."
3,3,CAT,0.600000,"Mmm!!! Something smells good! What is it?  It's me! I love this aftershave!"
3,3,LISTER,1.000000,"You are five minutes away from the greatest meal of your life, man, so set your tastebuds on Defcom 3!"
3,3,CAT,-0.500000,"Hey, you've really made an effort here! Where'd you get all this stuff?"
3,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"I just got sick and tired of using plastic knives and forks, man, so I went to the medical unit and nicked some gear."
3,3,CAT,0.333333,"This is a scalpel! I'm supposed to cut my food with a scalpel? Something that has been inside someone's guts?"
3,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"It's all been cleaned; it's all been washed; it's clean."
3,3,CAT,0.500000,"...something that, long ago in history, may well have performed a certain popular Jewish operation? I'm supposed to eat with this?"
3,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Get the onion salads out of the fridge!"
3,3,CAT,0.000000,""Embryo Refrigeration Unit?!""
3,3,LISTER,0.333333,"How many times...? It's clean! It's been cleaned!"
3,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"They're in the kidney bowls, next to the {cholostomy} bag with the chilli sauce in it."
3,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Here we go, here we go!"
3,3,LISTER,-0.250000,"Yahoo! Come on, man, come on! It's ready! Sit down, sit down! One kebab for you ... ... and one kebab for me."
3,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Lemon juice?"
3,3,CAT,-1.000000,"What the hell is that?"
3,3,LISTER,0.000000,"It's a syringe."
3,3,CAT,0.000000,"What kind of syringe?"
3,3,LISTER,-0.666667,"It's for cows -- artificial insemination. It's been washed; it's clean; it's all been sterilised. Do you want lemon juice or what?"
3,3,CAT,0.000000,"Ahem. Excuse me."
3,3,LISTER,0.000000,"What? What about the meal?"
3,3,CAT,-1.000000,"This isn't a meal -- this is an autopsy!"
3,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"It's only the starter, man! What about the main course?"
3,3,CAT,0.000000,"Hey, you think I got nothing better to do than hang around watching you serve chicken {chaucer} in a stool bucket?"
3,3,LISTER,0.750000,"Oh, charming.  I dunno. You pull out all the stops ... you make an effort ... try and do something with a little bit of extra class, and where does it get you?  Mmm, very cheeky!"
3,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt, sir.  I just need to get a, heh heh... er, sorry."
3,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Oh, no, Kryten, it's all right. Just running a few of the old home movies."
3,3,RIMMER,-0.571429,"That's me, there. Those are my brothers: John, Frank, and Howard. God, we were close. "The Four Musketeers," we used to call ourselves. Well, "The Three Musketeers," actually -- they always let me be the Queen of Spain. Marvellous. I mean, yes, I was the butt of the occasional practical joke, but I mean, er, nothing sinister."
3,3,RIMMER,-0.750000,"Just the usual boyhood pranks, you know: apple-pied beds, and black-eyed telescope ... and, one time, they even hid a small land mine in my sand pit. They took it from my father's gun cabinet. I mean, how were they supposed to know it was going to go off? Marvellous guys."
3,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Oh, and, er, who's that, there? and old girlfriend, Mr Arnold, sir?"
3,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Hardly."
3,3,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Ah, no. Not really your type, I suppose -- silly old trout like that."
3,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"She's my mother."
3,3,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Oh! I am so sorry, sir!!!"
3,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Just forget it."
3,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Oh, how can I forget it, sir? I compared your mother to a foolish, aged, blubbery fish! I said she was a simple-minded, scaly old piscine! I estimated she was an ugly, lungless marine animal with galloping senility! A putrid amphibious gillbreather with with less brains than a mollusc!"
3,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Forget it!  Ah! Freeze!"
3,3,RIMMER,-0.142857,"Ah, there she is -- magnificent woman. Very prim, very proper. Some say austere. Some people took her for cold, thought she was aloof. Not a bit of it -- she just despised idiots; no time for fools. Tragic, really. Otherwise we would have got on famously."
3,3,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Well, if you'll excuse me, sir, I'll go now -- this is clearly a very private family moment. I've no fish to embarrass you further. I'll let myself trout.  Oh, sir, I'm--"
3,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Just go!"
3,3,HOLLY,1.000000,"I don't want you to panic, Arn, but it does appear there's a very tiny possibility that there may very well in all likelihood possibly be a non-human life form on board."
3,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"You mean like last time, when you got us all worked up and we went scooting off down to the cargo bay complete with bazookoids and backpacks, and it turned out to be one of Lister's socks?"
3,3,HOLLY,0.000000,"I didn't recognise the genetic structure. Biologically speaking, they were a completely new life form."
3,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Absolutely ridiculous! I felt the total goit."
3,3,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Well, I think you should take a butchers."
3,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Where is it?"
3,3,HOLLY,-0.500000,"I lost it. It's somewhere along the habitation decks."
3,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I can't get a moment's peace in this place..."
3,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Enjoying your meal, sir?"
3,3,LISTER,0.000000,"It's delicious, Kryten -- de-smegging-licious. It's my own recipe, you know: Shami Kebab Diablo! It's beautiful, man. It's like eating molten lava. I cooked up one for Petersen once, you know ... he was in sickbay for a week -- for a week!"
3,3,LISTER,0.000000,"What'd you say?"
3,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I didn't say anything, sir."
3,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Do you seriously like them that hot, sir?"
3,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"It's trying to kill me!"
3,3,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Oh, it's a good one, huh?"
3,3,LISTER,1.000000,"It went under here -- I can see it!"
3,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Are you all right, sir?"
3,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Smeg! It's gone!"
3,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"What?"
3,3,LISTER,-0.166667,"How can that be? Where could it go?  We better get out of here, Kryten. Something very weird is going on. Something very, very-- ooh! There's some kind of pain in my groin..."
3,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"What's wrong?"
3,3,LISTER,0.500000,"My underpants -- they're shrinking! Oh god! The boxers are alive, man! They're getting smaller!!!"
3,3,LISTER,0.500000,"Help me, please! Please!!!"
3,3,LISTER,-0.666667,"Please, I'm begging you! Get them off, man! Pull them down!"
3,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Well, I can't say I'm totally shocked... You'll bonk anything, won't you, Lister!"
3,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Kryten, the boxers: where are they?"
3,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I threw them over here."
3,3,LISTER,0.000000,"You sure?"
3,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"There's nothing here!"
3,3,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Just the blanket, and the pillows, and the..."
3,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Snake!!!"
3,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"... snake."
3,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Snake?!"
3,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"What the smeg is going on?"
3,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"I hate snakes! They freak me out totally, snakes."
3,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"They are my all-time second-worst fear, guy."
3,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"What's your first?"
3,3,LISTER,0.000000,"This."
3,3,CAT,0.000000,"Is he OK?"
3,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"As far as we can tell, yes."
3,3,CAT,0.000000,"So where'd the creature go?"
3,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Well, it turned into a kind of splodgy, squelchy thing and squidged off down the corridor."
3,3,CAT,0.000000,"What is it? Some kind of alien?"
3,3,HOLLY,-0.666667,"No, it's from Earth -- man made. I checked out its DNA profile. Some kind of genetic experiment that went wrong."
3,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Apparently, it was an attempt to create the ultimate warrior -- a mutant that could change shape to suit its terrain and deceive its enemies."
3,3,CAT,0.000000,"So what did go wrong?"
3,3,KRYTEN,1.000000,"It's insane!"
3,3,HOLLY,-1.000000,"It feeds off the negative emotions -- fear, guilt, anger, paranoia -- drains them out of its prey."
3,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"It's a sort of emotional vampire. It changes shape to provoke a negative emotion -- in Lister's case, it took him to the very limit of his terror, then sucked out his fear."
3,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"So now Lister's got no sense of fear?"
3,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Precisely."
3,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"What are we going to do?"
3,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well, I say let's get out there and twat it!"
3,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Lister, you're ill. Just relax and leave this to us."
3,3,LISTER,0.000000,"I could have had it in the sleeping quarters, but you saw it -- you saw it -- it took me by surprise."
3,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Lister, it turned into an eight-foot-tall, armour-plated alien killing machine."
3,3,LISTER,1.000000,"If it wants a Bonney, we'll give it one! One swift knee in the happy sacks; it'll drop like anyone else!"
3,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"Fine, well, we'll bear that in mind when we're planning our strategy."
3,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"I'm gonna rip out its windpipe and beat it death with the tonsil end."
3,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"Yes, yes, very good..."
3,3,LISTER,0.000000,"I'm gonna stick my fist so far down its gob, I'll be able to pull the label off its underpants."
3,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Yes, yes... Kryten..."
3,3,LISTER,0.000000,"What's that, pal? You starting trouble??"
3,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"It's just a little something to calm you down, sir."
3,3,LISTER,-0.200000,"Come on, then! All of you, slags! All together or one at a time! I don't care -- it's all the same to me! I'm..."
3,3,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Ah, thank god for that. Right -- as far as I can see it, we have two options: One, we take it on and kill it; or Two, run away. Who's for Two?"
3,3,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Two sounds pretty good to me, sir."
3,3,CAT,1.000000,"It's always been my lucky number."
3,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"Right, well, let's load up Starbug and get out of here."
3,3,HOLLY,0.000000,"What about Lister?"
3,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"Oh, just seal the hatch from the inside. He'll be safe here until we're ready to go."
3,3,HOLLY,1.000000,"Remember: it's out there, and it could be anything."
3,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"Let's move it."
3,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"What about the Space Corps Directive which states, "It is our primary overriding duty to contact other life forms, exchange information, and, wherever possible, bring them home?""
3,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"What about the Rimmer Directive which states, "Never tangle with anything that's got more teeth than the entire Osmond family?""
3,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"It's here."
3,3,CAT,0.000000,"Where?"
3,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Somewhere."
3,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Set the bazookoids to heat-seeker."
3,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"When you see it, aim roughly in its direction, and the heat seekers will do the rest."
3,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Is that a shadow?  It's in the shadows! There! There! There!"
3,3,RIMMER,0.333333,"Sorry. My fault. False alarm."
3,3,CAT,0.000000,"Idiot."
3,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"I don't understand it -- holograms don't produce heat, and neither do androids. What are they homing in on?"
3,3,CAT,1.000000,"So long, guys."
3,3,CAT,1.000000,"Oh, come on -- give me a break!"
3,3,CAT,-0.500000,"You either got it or you ain't. Boys, you ain't even close."
3,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Cat, where are you?"
3,3,CAT,0.000000,"Over here!"
3,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"Stay put -- we'll come and find you."
3,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Keep talking!"
3,3,CAT,-0.500000,"A mutant. It's dangerous -- it can turn into anything!"
3,3,CAT,0.500000,"It is, baby. Believe me."
3,3,CAT,-1.000000,"Well, I guess you're right!"
3,3,CAT,0.166667,"Smart? Yeah, you definitely have to be smart. Like I say, it can turn into anything. You gotta have your wits about you all the time -- don't let up for one second, or it'll just creep up on you and blip! you're dog meat.  Come on, babe."
3,3,CAT,0.000000,"Oh, you think handsome?"
3,3,CAT,-1.000000,"Well, I wasn't going to be the first to say it."
3,3,CAT,0.000000,"Hmm?"
3,3,CAT,-1.000000,"Well, I'm sure I have a window in my schedule somewhere. Let's see ... er, what are you doing in, say, ten seconds time?"
3,3,CAT,0.000000,"Hi. I'm the Cat."
3,3,CAT,0.000000,"Glad to know you ... Genny who?"
3,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"It's got him! It's got him!"
3,3,KRYTEN,0.500000,"Oh, my goodness! Are you all right?"
3,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Is he dead?"
3,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Unconscious, but, according to the psi scan, he appears to have lost an emotion."
3,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Which emotion?"
3,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"He's lost his vanity!"
3,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"This is your fault, Kryten."
3,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"M-M-M-My fault?"
3,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"We were supposed to stick together. You let the Cat run off alone."
3,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"But it wasn't... I mean..."
3,3,RIMMER,0.500000,"He trusted you. Now look at him."
3,3,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Oh, please... I feel so--"
3,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"GUILTY?!!!"
3,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Yes."
3,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"GOOD!!!"
3,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Let's just get Lister and get out of here!"
3,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"It's got my guilt! I have lost the single emotion which prevents my transgressing the mores, moras, and matters of civilised society."
3,3,RIMMER,0.666667,"Stop your blithering, Kryten. Come on! Grab the Cat, and let's go!"
3,3,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Oh, screw you, hadron-head!"
3,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Where have you been? Let's go!"
3,3,CAT,-1.000000,"I've been getting myself comfortable, man."
3,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Come on, Kryten! You're holding us all up!"
3,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Ah, who cares?"
3,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"You're going to get us all killed!"
3,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"So?"
3,3,KRYTEN,0.500000,"Oh, look! It's Bonehead's mum."
3,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Mother?"
3,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"What are you doing?"
3,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"You've just made love to my mother!?"
3,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah. Do you want to make something of it?"
3,3,HOLLY,-1.000000,"It's not your mother, it's the polymorph!"
3,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"You've just had my mum!?"
3,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,""Very prim, very proper, almost austere!""
3,3,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Don't fall for it, Arn -- it's trying to make you angry!"
3,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I think I'm going to be sick."
3,3,HOLLY,0.500000,"Don't get angry! That's what it wants!"
3,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"Lister and mother... It's a dream come true."
3,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"How lovely."
3,3,RIMMER,0.666667,"Terrific. That sounds enchanting. Well done."
3,3,HOLLY,1.000000,"Cool it, Arnie!"
3,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"ALPHABETTI SPAGHETTI?!!!"
3,3,CAT,0.000000,"Where is it now?"
3,3,HOLLY,-1.000000,"It's gone back down to the cargo bays, sleeping off a four-course meal of fear, vanity, guilt, and anger. You'd better get it before it comes back for seconds."
3,3,RIMMER,0.500000,"Look, just because it's an armour-plated alien killing machine that salivates unspeakable slobber, doesn't mean it's a bad person. What we've got to do is get it round a table, and put together a solution package -- perhaps over tea and biscuits."
3,3,KRYTEN,-0.666667,"Look at him! You can't trust his opinion -- he's got no anger. He's a total dork!"
3,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Good point, Kryten. Let's take that on board, shall we? Erm, David? David, do you have anything you want to bring to this forum?"
3,3,LISTER,0.333333,"Well, yes, I have, actually, Arnold. Why don't we go down to the ammunition stores, get the nuclear warheads and then strap one to my head? I'll nuke the smegger to oblivion!"
3,3,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Right, well, that's very nice, David. Let's put that on the back burner, shall we? Erm, Cat, let's have your contribution ... come on."
3,3,CAT,-1.000000,"Hey, don't ask me my opinion -- I'm nobody. Just pretend I'm not here."
3,3,RIMMER,0.750000,"That's lovely. Thank you very much. Erm, moving on a step -- and I hope no-one thinks that I'm setting myself up as a self-elected chairperson ... just see me as a facilitator -- erm, Kryten, what's your view? Don't be shy."
3,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well, I think we should send Lister in as a decoy, and, while it's busy eating him alive, we could creep up on it unawares and blast it into the stratosphere."
3,3,LISTER,0.333333,"Good plan! That's the best plan yet! Let it get knackered eating me to death, then you guys could just, like, catch it unawares!"
3,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Well, that's certainly an option, David, yes. Erm, but here's my proposal: Let's get tough. The time for talking is over. Call it extreme if you like, but I propose we hit it hard and hit it fast with a major -- and I mean major -- leaflet campaign, and while it's reeling from that, we'd follow up with a {whist} drive, a car boot sale, some street theatre and possibly even some benefit concerts. OK? Now, if that's not enough, I'm sorry, it's time for the T-shirts: "Mutants Out" ... "Chameleonic Life Forms, No Thanks" ... and if that's not enough, well, I don't know what will be."
3,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Has anyone ever told you that you are a disgusting, pus-filled bubo who has all the wit, charm and self-possession of an Alsatian dog after a head-swap operation?"
3,3,LISTER,0.333333,"Listen, you bunch of tarts, it's clobbering time!  There's a body bag out there with that scudball's name on it, and I'm doing up the zip. Anyone who gets in my way gets a napalm enema!"
3,3,CAT,-1.000000,"I think everybody's right, except me, so just forget I spoke, all right?"
3,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Erm, I think we're all beginning to lose sight of the real issue here, which is: what are we going to call ourselves? Erm, and I think it comes down to a choice between "The League Against Salivating Monsters" or, my own personal preference, which is "The Committee for the Liberation and Integration of Terrifying Organisms and their Rehabilitation Into Society." Erm, one drawback with that -- the abbreviation is "CLITORIS.""
3,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"Look, it needs killing! If that means I have to sacrifice my life in some stupid pointless way, then all the better!"
3,3,KRYTEN,-0.666667,"Yes! Why not? I mean, even if it doesn't work, it'll still be a laugh!"
3,3,LISTER,-0.333333,"Right, so let's just cut all of this business and get on with it! Last one alive's a wet ponce. Who's with me?"
3,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Well, the car stickers aren't ready until Thursday, but sometimes one just has to act spontaneously. People, let's go."
3,3,CAT,-1.000000,"Hey, I'm coming, too. Maybe I can bum some money off him."
3,3,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Maybe if I hand you guys over, it'll let me go. MOVE IT, SUCKERS!"
3,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Come on, you chicken. Show us your slobbery chops, and we'll blow them off."
3,3,KRYTEN,0.666667,"Here they are -- nice juicy humans! Come and get them! Heeere, muty mutant!"
3,3,CAT,0.000000,"Phewee! What am I wearing?"
3,3,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Oh, how can you ever forgive me, sirs? Naturally, I will commit suicide immediately."
3,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Hey... We were all a bit whacked out there."
3,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"You can say that again."
3,3,CAT,0.000000,"Come on -- let's go and clean up. If I don't get into some co- ordinated evening wear, I'm going to have to resign my post as Most Handsome Guy on the Ship."
3,4,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Turn. There's another. Circuit board epsilon 14598, red corridor 357."
3,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Re-routed."
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Turn. And another. Circuit board theta 29555, rlue corridor 212."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"What's happening guys? It's half ten. I thought we were playing poker?"
3,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Where have you been? Didn't you get the message?"
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"What message?"
3,4,RIMMER,-0.833333,"One of the skutters has gone bananas. He's completely rewired the maintenance decks back to front and upside down. We've got over two thousand wiring faults. Don't breath. Don't touch anything. The whole ship is a gigantic booby trap."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"No poker then?"
3,4,RIMMER,-0.333333,"We can't find the auto destruct system. It's wired up to something but we don't know what. Tell the CAT."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"It's taken me ages to mark these cards."
3,4,CAT,-1.000000,"So we can't touch anything?"
3,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Nothing electrical. Not until we get the all clear."
3,4,CAT,0.000000,"How longs that going to take?"
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"God knows."
3,4,LISTER,-0.333333,"Milk shake and a crispy bar.  We were just playing poker tonight. That's gone for a burn."
3,4,CAT,-1.000000,"That's a very dumb thing you just did then."
3,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"I Know. I wasn't thinking."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Cancel. Clear."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Cancel!"
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Cancel!"
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Cancel!"
3,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I said, "Touch nothing." Didn't I say, "Touch nothing?""
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Look, I just ordered a shake and a crispy bar."
3,4,CAT,0.000000,"You're lucky you didn't order a double cheese burger!"
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"How do we switch it off?"
3,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"The only person who can override the autodestruct is the captain."
3,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Dead."
3,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"Or one of the senior officers."
3,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Dead."
3,4,HOLLY,1.000000,"In many ways I should have updated the system really."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Is there any that we can trick the machine into thinking one of us is the captain?"
3,4,HOLLY,-0.500000,"No. It checks his voice and brain scan against its databanks."
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Think of something please. You are supposed to have an IQ of 6000. Think of something."
3,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"I'm thinking."
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Well??"
3,4,HOLLY,-0.750000,"I bin' through the whole of my database, collated every single option, and there are three realistic alternatives. One: sit 'ere and get blown up. Two: Stand 'ere and get blown up. Three: Jump up and down, shout at me for not being able to think of anything, then get blown up."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"There must be something?"
3,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Perhaps we could try a mind swap?"
3,4,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"It's something we tried once on the Nova 5. It uses exactly the same science as generating a hologram. We wipe all your brain patterns and put them on a storage disk. Then we transfer the captains mind from his hologram personality disk into your empty brain."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"And you tried this on the Nova 5?"
3,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Oh Yes."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Did it work?"
3,4,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"No. But I'm pretty sure I know what went wrong."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"So the captain's mind will be in my body?"
3,4,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Yes. Then, hopefully, the self destruct will think you're are the captain, and you can activate the override."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"But where will my mind be?"
3,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"On this."
3,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"We couldn't find the captains disk, but what about Brown? Brown was executive officer."
3,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"Yeah. Brown's got clearance."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Kryten, what's that for?"
3,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"It's a mental emetic."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"A what?"
3,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"A mind enema -- so we can flush out your brain."
3,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Nobody's flush'n out my brain."
3,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"We'll transfer it back afterwards."
3,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"You are not sticking that think in my head."
3,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"We've got to. It's our only chance."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Smeg Off!"
3,4,CAT,-0.250000,"Look man, I'm not asking you to do this just for me. I'm askin', well pleading with you I'm beggin' ya -- do it for the sake of my suits. Are you just gonna stand by and let my scarlet PVC morning suit with the imitation king penguin fur collars get blown to smithereens. Could you live with yourself?"
3,4,RIMMER,-0.600000,"Look, Lister. I agree, it's a stupid idea. It almost certainly wont work. But the very worst that can happen -- the absolute bottom line -- is that you'll have to spend the rest of your life as a mindless gibbering vegetable. But if the rest of your life is going to be thirty seconds, what the hell!"
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Do it."
3,4,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Keep that safe -- it's Lister's mind."
3,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Ah, sir. There is no time to explain, but, by a bizarre series of accidents the ship auto destruct system has got switched on and we need you to deactivate it."
3,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Look, you stupid women, we'll explain later."
3,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"If we don't override the autodestruct system within the next 20 seconds those male sexual organs will be in orbit around the nearest planet. Along with every one else's organs sexual or otherwise."
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Sen-smegging-sational"
3,4,CAT,1.000000,"Well done, sphinx face."
3,4,RIMMER,1.000000,"What a brilliant, brilliant plan."
3,4,CAT,1.000000,"Just great."
3,4,CAT,0.000000,"What happened?"
3,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"It must have been wired up to the warning system but not the bomb."
3,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"So where's the bomb?"
3,4,HOLLY,-1.000000,"We haven't got a bomb."
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"What!"
3,4,HOLLY,1.000000,"I got rid of it ages ago."
3,4,CAT,-1.000000,"Why didn't you say?"
3,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"You never asked."
3,4,CAT,0.000000,"Fine, terrific.  But remember this: you're getting my underwear bill, buddy."
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"You awake?"
3,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Yeah -- can't sleep."
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Probably those kippers you had for supper."
3,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Nothin' wrong with kippers for supper."
3,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"But kippers vindaloo? Can't be good for you. I mean, a curry every night? That cannot be good for you. Certainly no good for me. I'm thinking of getting a canary in a cage."
3,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Why?"
3,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"To check out the room, see if it is safe to use."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"C'mon, it's not that bad!"
3,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Not that bad? You don't sweat sweat, you sweat madras sauce."
3,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Why all the sudden interest in my diet?"
3,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"It's not just your diet, Lister. It's your health in general. Face facts: you eat crap, you don't exercise, you smoke, you drink, and frankly, it's beginning to show."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"I'm OK."
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"You're getting porky."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Porky!"
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Last week when there was that lights failure in the engine room, your silhouette was caste onto the wall. I got the fright of my life. I thought it was Alfred Hitchcock."
3,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Are you sayin' I've got a gut?"
3,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"You have got more gut that a Turkish butchers shop window."
3,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Hang on, no really. Do you think I've put on weight?"
3,4,RIMMER,-0.333333,"You've reached that age, Listy. When you're younger you can eat what you like, drink what you like and still climb into your 26 inch waist trousers and zip them closed. Then you reach that age -- 24, 25 -- your muscles give up they wave a little white flag and then without any warning at all, you're suddenly a fat bastard."
3,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"I'm not fat -- I'm porky!"
3,4,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Have you ever in dissection class held up a frog by its head? You know the way its belly sort of sticks out above its spindly little legs? Well, that's the picture I see when you get down from the bunk in the morning."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah, maybe you're right.  Yeah, I'm gonna start working out in the gym."
3,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Of course, you could always ... no you'd never a agree to it."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"What?"
3,4,RIMMER,-0.600000,"We could do a swap: my mind in your body, yours in mine. You saw how easy it was with Brown. Lend me your body for a few weeks and I'll get it fit for you. Plenty of exercise, sensible diet, no more booze, no more ciggies. It'll be like a 12 thousand mile service for your body."
3,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"What, and in the meantime I'm a hologram?"
3,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"It won't be too bad if it's only for a couple of weeks."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"You're talking as if it were a pare of hedge trimmers or a lawn mower or somethin'."
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"I'd give it you back, I'd return it intact. More than intact, it'd be fitter."
3,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Look, Rimmer, you are not having possession of my body."
3,4,RIMMER,-0.200000,"What are you worried about? How can a treat it any worse than you do? You admit you don't look after it, don't exercise it, don't feed it properly. I would. What do you say?"
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"No welchin'."
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Of course not."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"A fortnight."
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"14 days."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Two weeks."
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Absolutely doodley."
3,4,LISTER,-0.333333,"This hat is smeggin' stupid. I look like Captain Emerald. Holly, do somethin' about it, mate."
3,4,HOLLY,1.000000,"OK, Dave."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Brutal!"
3,4,RIMMER,0.500000,"What's this under his nails? Oh my god!"
3,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I'm going to have this dirt carbon-dated."
3,4,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Luncheon, sir."
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Ahhh! Food. Real food. To eat, perchance to taste."
3,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"It's exactly as you ordered, sir: the lightly poached mimmion bladder fish, the 4 dozen oysters, the ducks feet in abalone sauce..."
3,4,RIMMER,1.000000,"I can touch; I can taste; I can smell!"
3,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Roast suckling pig stuffed with chestnuts and truffles."
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"mmmmmmm."
3,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Mashed potato."
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"With cream and butter?"
3,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"A pint of cream and a full pound of butter, sir."
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Let the orgy commence."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Hows the diet goin'?"
3,4,RIMMER,-0.600000,"Do you know something I think I went temporarily insane. It was just too much. I haven't tasted food in 3 million and 2 years. All that food. I was like an animal."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"I want my body back. Now!"
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Oh Look it won't happen again. It was just something I had to get out of my system."
3,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"My system. Why ya smokin'?"
3,4,RIMMER,1.000000,"One cigar!"
3,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"You are supposed to be getting me fit."
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"I'll start tomorrow."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"You better bleedin' had do."
3,4,CAT,-0.500000,"Hey! what are you doin' dressed like that? Why do you want to look like Goalpost Head? Have you flipped? You want to model yourself on a man who has ears so large that they can pick up satellite TV? Why do you want to look like the smeg-head Rimmer for?!"
3,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Because... ...I am that smeg head Rimmer."
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Please. These are meant to be women?  Ahhh. This is what I call training."
3,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"That letter, that letter, and that letter.  There."
3,4,CAT,0.333333,"Hey! I've got you now!  Jozxyqk."
3,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"That's not a word."
3,4,CAT,0.000000,"It's a cat word."
3,4,CAT,-1.000000,"That's not how you pronounce it!"
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"What's it mean?"
3,4,CAT,0.000000,"It's the sound you get when you get your sexual organs trapped in something"
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Is it in the dictionary?"
3,4,CAT,-0.500000,"Well, it could be. If you were reading in the nude and you closed the book too quickly."
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Ahhhh! What a session! What a work out! No pain, no gain, Listy."
3,4,LISTER,0.500000,"On the scales! I want to weigh you."
3,4,RIMMER,-0.750000,"There's no need. Look at that stomach.  Flat as a pancake. Hasn't been like that in years!"
3,4,LISTER,1.000000,"Scales, please."
3,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"There's really no need."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"On the scales."
3,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"You've put on two stone!"
3,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Of course I've put on two stone. I've been taking yeast extract, building up your body."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Take the robe off."
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"What for?"
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Take it off."
3,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I don't want you looking at my naked body."
3,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"It's not your naked body, it's mine!"
3,4,CAT,0.000000,"What's he hidin'?"
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Off with the robe."
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Let me just say this--"
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Off!"
3,4,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Ohhhh this. This is a hernia prevention belt. I must have forgotten to take it off."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"It's a girdle."
3,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Course it isn't."
3,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Then why has it got little dangly things for holding up stockings?"
3,4,RIMMER,0.333333,"There for attaching extra weights to you so you can get fit just as you walk around.  Oh! Errrr ow!"
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"I want me body back now."
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Look, OK. I went a bit bananas the first few days, but I promise you that's all over now. Don't you see? It's in my interest to get you into shape. This could become a regular thing: fourteen days a year I could have your body. In fact next year, if it's convenient, I would like to book the last two weeks of July."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"I want it back."
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"One last chance?"
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"No more troffin'."
3,4,RIMMER,1.000000,"I promise."
3,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"And take that girdle off. It doesn't suit me."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Holly, lights."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Right, that's it! I'm completely sick of it."
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"MM-mph? Mph mmph mph?"
3,4,LISTER,1.000000,"That is it!"
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"What is it?"
3,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"You've been porkin' again, haven't ya?"
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"I have not!"
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"I want my body back, now."
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"But I've only had it a week!"
3,4,LISTER,-0.166667,"This was not the deal. You've welched on it.  And what's this in the bin? Me locks! My locks are in the bin. I thought you said you pinned 'em up?"
3,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I did but they ... fell off."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Fell off? Science lab, now!"
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"But it's the middle of the night. Kryten is on down time."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Now!"
3,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"How many cigars did you get through, Rimmer? Me lungs feel as if they have been through a cheese grater."
3,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"You've got your body back. Leave me alone."
3,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"I only have a couple of rolly's a day. It feels as if you've smoked an entire Cuban tobacco harvest."
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"I had the odd one."
3,4,LISTER,-0.166667,"You've no respect, that's what. You've shown my body no respect whatsoever. You've treated it like smeg. Look you've given me breasts. There's a distinct cleavage there. I give you my body and you've given me a bosom."
3,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"These scales are wrong. These scales have to be wrong."
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"It's average for your height."
3,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Rimmer, it would be average for my height if I happened to be a pregnant hippo."
3,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Well you weren't exactly Charles Atlas to start with, were you?"
3,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"And you haven't been treating my athletes foot, have you?"
3,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Well, quite frankly I was afraid of touching it."
3,4,LISTER,0.500000,"I told you, you have to wash and powder my feet three times a day. Plus a good buffing with a pumice stone."
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"I wasn't prepared to touch those things three time a day. To tell you the truth I was only brave enough to take your socks off once."
3,4,LISTER,-0.333333,"Look at my stomach. Look at it! Pink gudgeon' stripes down me sides and you could float me over the super bowl."
3,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Look I refuse to take the rap for that body. All right I added a few pounds to its already ample frame but it was, lets face it, a wreck before I got any where near it."
3,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"A wreck?"
3,4,RIMMER,-0.400000,"If it was a car you would be an insurance write off. Nothing works. Your taste buds are totally clapped out you've killed them stone dead with 25 years of non stop curries. and what about all the aches and pains you never mention twinges in your back crimps in your neck mention? Oh, and I'll give you a little tip: urine should only be green if you're mister spock."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"That's the last time you borrow it that's for goddam sure."
3,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"What about next year? We had and agreement -- the last two weeks in July and the weekend before Christmas."
3,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"What for, Rimmer? It's a wreck."
3,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Unfortunately it's the best that's available. You can't get two weeks in the carribean then grimsby is better than nothing. You can't back out now, you said I could have it."
3,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"I only said that to get it back. Do you think I am raving mad? You are never, ever, ever borrowing my body again. Never."
3,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Get some sleep. You'll feel different in the morning."
3,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I am really not sure about this."
3,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Look, you're programmed to obey -- get on with it."
3,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"But surely we should ask him first?"
3,4,RIMMER,1.000000,"I told you, he's agreed. He's perfectly happy about the situation."
3,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well then, why did you make me chloroform him and why did he struggle so?"
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Look, I'm in charge Kryten. I'll take full responsibility."
3,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Oh! But sir--"
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Science lab, pronto!"
3,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Oh!"
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"If he comes around give him another whack."
3,4,LISTER,-0.200000,"Are you awake man? Rimmer?  No please. No!  Play message."
3,4,RIMMER,-0.142857,"Hi! It's me. I told you you'd feel different in the morning. Thing is, this week has been absolute heaven for me and I couldn't just stand by and let you take your body back. That's why I've taken Starbug and done a runner. Don't worry, in a month or so I'll come back and return it. Just a month, maybe six weeks but don't try and follow me, otherwise... the body gets it."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Cat. Cat!"
3,4,CAT,0.000000,"You want my what?"
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"It'll only take a couple of hours."
3,4,CAT,0.000000,"You want to take my body?"
3,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"I need your body to get my body back."
3,4,CAT,-1.000000,"You've already lost one body. Come on, in all seriousness, you really expect me to lend you mine?"
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"I'm a hologram. How else am I suppose to chase him? I need your body."
3,4,CAT,-0.500000,"Let me ask you one question. Would you let a garbage truck driver use your Rolls Royce?"
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"How else can I pilot White Midget?"
3,4,CAT,1.000000,"I'll do it!"
3,4,LISTER,0.250000,"Rimmer. Rimmer! It's no use runnin', man, we've got you in visual range. Turn around and head back to the ship."
3,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"I told you not to follow me.  Leave me alone or you-know-what happens."
3,4,CAT,1.000000,"He's bluffin'."
3,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I'm not bluffing."
3,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"I think he means it man. He's flipped -- it must be cream cake poisonin'."
3,4,CAT,0.500000,"He's bluffin. I'm goin' in after him."
3,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"He must be bluffing."
3,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Say he isn't, man?"
3,4,CAT,-0.500000,"It's gastronomic terrorism! We can't stand by and let it happen."
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Go ahead punks. Make my day."
3,4,LISTER,0.500000,"You're right. He's bluffin'."
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Smeg!"
3,4,CAT,0.000000,"Lets get him."
3,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"This is getting stupid. Back off -- let him go."
3,4,CAT,-1.000000,"We're almost on him."
3,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"It's too dangerous. Let him go."
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Ha! Ha! Ha! Chickens. Ha ..."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Oh smeg! What the smeggin' smeg's he smeggin' done? He's smeggin' killed me!"
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Whoops!"
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Are you all right?"
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"You're going to go spare."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"What? What is it?"
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"You're going to go absolutely spare."
3,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"You've lost me arm."
3,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I've lost your watch too."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"You Bastard!"
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"No, you're right. It's my fault. My hands are up ... well, my hand is up."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"You think this is funny?"
3,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"No. But this is."
3,4,LISTER,0.500000,"Oh, Hello. It's captain chloroform."
3,4,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"Oh please, mister David sir. My guilt chips is already in overdrive. I, I feel terrible!"
3,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"You feel terrible? How about my smeggin' head?"
3,4,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"I had to obey him. It's in my programming to obey all humans. No matter how insane."
3,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Dinner is served, sir."
3,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"Lettuce and a grated carrot. I'm on this for six months."
3,4,LISTER,0.000000,"What's wrong with you? You look like you've seen a ghost."
3,4,CAT,-1.000000,"I was asleep, OK? Next thing I know plastic Percy here puts a sponge on my face and out go the lights."
3,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"It was an order."
3,4,RIMMER,0.666667,"Just one night, I promise. I'll give it back first thing tomorrow. Maybe Thursday."
3,5,CAT,0.000000,"Okay, okay, okay. Uphill, slight barrow to the left."
3,5,CAT,0.500000,"Yes, yes, yes, YES! Yow!"
3,5,CAT,0.000000,"Yay! Four up, with six to play! This guy is hot, hot, HOT! Okay, hole 13."
3,5,LISTER,0.000000,"What am I doing? What am I doing here?"
3,5,CAT,-1.000000,"You're not following through is what you're doing! Keep your head down and follow through!"
3,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Why am I playing this?"
3,5,CAT,0.333333,"Because it's Sunday! Time to relax, time to chill! Lighten up!"
3,5,LISTER,-0.333333,"I can't lighten up! I hate my life! We seem to spend every day devising more and more ingenious ways of wasting time. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of table golf, I'm sick of tiddlywinks show jumping! I'm sick of stretching a pair of tights across the room and playing durex volleyball!"
3,5,CAT,0.000000,"If you like, we'll kick the golf on the head, okay?"
3,5,CAT,1.000000,"How about a game of Junior Angler? All the thrills and spills of fresh water fly fishing from the comfort of your own living room!"
3,5,LISTER,0.000000,"No!"
3,5,CAT,-0.333333,"Got it! Unicycle Polo! We could have a quick chucker on floor 14!"
3,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"It's smegging stupid! Two grown men on unicycles, belting a beach ball up and down the corridor, with french loaves! It's pathetic. It's idiotic. It's, it's, it's puerile!"
3,5,CAT,1.000000,"Well, you invented it!"
3,5,LISTER,0.250000,"I want a life! This, it's worse than prison! I mean, at least in prison you can look forward to getting out. I want to live. I want a job. I want to meet people. I want to meet girls. I want to make love!"
3,5,CAT,-1.000000,"Well, Junior Angler is the best you're gonna get out of me, baby!"
3,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Just get out of my face."
3,5,CAT,0.000000,"Okay, okay, but don't come running to me next time you want someone to play soapsud slalom down the cargo ramp. You can carry your own damn flags!"
3,5,RIMMER,1.500000,"Lovely service, Lister! You should have come -- most uplifting!"
3,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"What's wrong with you? Ah, it's November! Nearly time for your bath!"
3,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Please just spare me the good mood? I just can't handle it right now. OK?"
3,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"What happened to you?"
3,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"I'm sick of it, that's what. I'm just totally, totally sick of it."
3,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Sick of what?"
3,5,LISTER,-1.500000,"I'm sick of you and your silly green suits, I'm sick of your stupid flared nostrils. I'm sick of the way you always smile when you're being insulted."
3,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"I'm sick of the Cat. I'm sick of Holly. I'm sick of you. I'm sick of me. And as for Kryten ... I'm sick of him. I'm sick of this ship, sick of this life. I'm just sick of it."
3,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"You're unhappy, aren't you?"
3,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Joining the Space Corps -- that's when it all went wrong. If I didn't join up things could really have worked out for me."
3,5,RIMMER,-0.200000,"That's a tension sheet, isn't it? I went to school with the guy who invented tension sheets. Things certainly worked out for him all right. A millionaire at twenty-six! Fred Holden -- he was in our dorm. God, he was thick. Thickie Holden, we used to call him: "Hello, Thickie! How's your acne, Thickie?" He always used to come bottom in geography. He thought a glacier was a bloke who fixed windows."
3,5,LISTER,-0.500000,"He can't have been that dense? I mean, he invented the tension sheet?"
3,5,RIMMER,0.333333,"It's just the stuff they used to use in packing paper. All he did was to paint it red and cut it into small squares. And you know who he married -- Sabrina Mulholland-JJones."
3,5,LISTER,0.000000,"The model?"
3,5,RIMMER,-0.500000,"How can that be? The most desirable woman in the western hemisphere and Thickie Holden, a spotty little gimp who used to blow off the bed-covers every time we had cauliflower cheese!"
3,5,LISTER,0.500000,"He had a break. He got lucky."
3,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"I suppose so. Did you go to school with anyone famous?"
3,5,LISTER,0.500000,"Charles Keenan. He was pretty famous."
3,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"What did he do?"
3,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Ate his wife."
3,5,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Sorry to interrupt, sirs, but I think you should come down to the photo-lab. Something quite strange is happening."
3,5,LISTER,-0.500000,"These are just ordinary photographs. What did you do to them?"
3,5,KRYTEN,1.000000,"I just developed the film as normal, and for some reason they came to life."
3,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"It's the developing fluid. It must have mutated."
3,5,KRYTEN,0.500000,"At first I thought it was just my roll of film, but it seems to work on any negative. There's some others here I've developed as slides."
3,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Go for it."
3,5,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Lights!"
3,5,RIMMER,0.500000,"That's Frank! That's my brother's wedding!"
3,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Yo, I'm in the photograph!"
3,5,LISTER,1.000000,"I'm actually in the photograph!"
3,5,LISTER,1.000000,"I'm actually here! I'm at a smeggin' wedding!"
3,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Wow, man! I'm back on Earth! I'm in a photograph!"
3,5,LISTER,0.666667,"Look! He can touch me! He can touch me!"
3,5,LISTER,0.571429,"OOF! He can actually punch me! This is brilliant! Punch me again!  Fantastic! OOF! Alright, alright, I'm going!"
3,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"I can't walk out of the edge of the photograph!"
3,5,LISTER,1.000000,"In-smeggin'-credible!"
3,5,RIMMER,1.000000,"Try another one."
3,5,CAT,0.000000,"What's this?"
3,5,KRYTEN,0.000000,"It's one of Lister's."
3,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"I don't recognise this."
3,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Who are they?"
3,5,LISTER,0.000000,"I don't know. Oh yeah, I remember. I sent away some snaps of me eighteenth birthday and got someone's skiing holiday back instead."
3,5,RIMMER,1.000000,"It's amazing. We're really here!"
3,5,LISTER,0.000000,"I know. Check this!"
3,5,KRYTEN,0.000000,"It even works in black and white. I tried it with a really old one, too."
3,5,RIMMER,-0.666667,"That's Nuremberg! That's Adolf Hitler. He was leader of the runners-up in World War II."
3,5,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I cut the photograph out of one of your magazines."
3,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Which magazine was that?"
3,5,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Fascist Dictator Monthly. He was Mr. October."
3,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Ignore him! He's a complete and total nutter! And he's only got one testicle!"
3,5,RIMMER,-0.333333,"What's he doing now? He's scuffling with Adolf Hitler! You can't just stick one on the leader of the Third Reich!"
3,5,LISTER,1.000000,"I nicked his briefcase!"
3,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Banana and crisps?"
3,5,LISTER,0.000000,"His diary!"
3,5,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"Allow me. I'll switch to "translation mode." "Things to remember: Stop milk, pay papers, invade Czechoslovakia.""
3,5,LISTER,0.000000,"A present here.  "To Adolf, Love & hugs, Staff Colonel Von Stauffenberg.""
3,5,RIMMER,-0.500000,"That rings a bell... Von Stauffenberg, he's famous for something... Wait a minute, he's the officer who tried to assassinate Hitler by putting a bomb in his briefcase!" How could I forget that?"
3,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Yes! I don't believe this. We've got ourselves a smeggin' time machine!"
3,5,RIMMER,1.000000,"So we can go anywhere we want, absolutely anywhere?"
3,5,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Providing we have a photograph of it."
3,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"So if one of us had, say, a photograph of a female-only naturist beach in Acapulco full of bronzed, naked, uninhibited teenage temptresses, we could go there for a holiday?"
3,5,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I suppose."
3,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Kryten, get my photo album."
3,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Hang on. The thing is, we can't move outside the confines of the photograph. What we see is all we get."
3,5,CAT,0.000000,"Meaning?"
3,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Meaning we can't get a picture of Earth and go back there, we wouldn't be able to move outside the frame of the photograph."
3,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Believe me, this beach shot in Acapulco, you wouldn't want to move outside the photograph!"
3,5,CAT,-1.000000,"So it's useless, then?"
3,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"No, not entirely useless. Think of the famous people we could meet, the famous places we could go."
3,5,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"We could go back to Dallas, in November 1963, stand on the grassy knoll and shout "Duck!" Oh, I'm sorry, I must have bypassed my "Good Taste" chip!"
3,5,RIMMER,-0.333333,"The possibilities are enormous! They're mind-numbing! We could go back in time and avert major disasters!"
3,5,LISTER,0.000000,"What, you mean like persuade Dustin Hoffman not to make Ishtar?"
3,5,HOLLY,-0.333333,"What about determinism, then? What about causality? You can't just mess about with history!"
3,5,LISTER,0.000000,"We'll just do something small."
3,5,HOLLY,-1.000000,"There's no such thing as "small" when you're talking about changing time!"
3,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"I'm only talking about changing things so that I don't get marooned in space."
3,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Such as?"
3,5,LISTER,0.000000,"If I can go back and fix things so that I don't join the Space Corps, don't sign up with Red Dwarf, I can create an alternate existence, a NORMAL existence, back on Earth. I won't be stuck with your ugly mush for the next 3 million years."
3,5,CAT,0.000000,"How can you do that?"
3,5,LISTER,0.000000,"With this, and this."
3,5,KRYTEN,0.000000,"It's ready."
3,5,CAT,0.000000,"What is this? Who is that jerk?"
3,5,LISTER,0.000000,"It's me."
3,5,CAT,0.000000,"You?"
3,5,LISTER,0.500000,"Aged 17. That's me first band, Smeg and The Heads."
3,5,CAT,0.000000,"What are you wearing?"
3,5,LISTER,-0.333333,"It was all the rage. It's what everyone was wearing. It was called "Sham Glam.""
3,5,CAT,0.000000,"Look at that collar! You could go hang-gliding!"
3,5,LISTER,0.000000,"We used to think we were so cool. Come on!"
3,5,LISTER,0.500000,"One of the first songs I ever wrote. It was called "Om"."
3,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Nothing like a good old-fashioned love song, eh?"
3,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"And to think I genuinely thought we were gonna be massive. God, I was stupid."
3,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Who are the other two?"
3,5,LISTER,-0.166667,"The whacked-out, crazy, hippy drummer's called Dobbin. He joined the police force in the end. Became a grand wizard in the Freemasons. The bass is called Gazza. He was a neo-marxist, nihilistic, anarchist. Eventually joined a large insurance company and got his own parking space."
3,5,LISTER,1.000000,"I'll catch you guys later."
3,5,KRYTEN,0.000000,"What is this place?"
3,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"It's a pub."
3,5,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"A "pub?" Ah yes, a meeting place where people attempt to achieve advanced states of mental incompetence by the repeated consumption of fermented vegetable drinks."
3,5,LISTER,-0.500000,"Guys, guys. I'd like you to meet me, aged 17."
3,5,LISTER,-0.500000,"Yeah. This is Cat, Kryten, and... Rimmer."
3,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Yes, indeed."
3,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Look, sit down and shut up!"
3,5,LISTER,0.000000,"I've come to try and change your future."
3,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"You don't make it as a rock star."
3,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"How can I say this without giving offense? You don't make it 'cos ... you're crap."
3,5,LISTER,1.000000,"I'm you, you dork!"
3,5,LISTER,-0.500000,"Look, will you shut up and listen? I'm trying to make you rich. All you've got to do is to go down to the patent office and register this as your invention.  It's called a "tension sheet.""
3,5,RIMMER,0.500000,"Uh-uh, that's a immoral. That's Thickie Holden's invention."
3,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Uh-uh, was!"
3,5,LISTER,0.000000,"I know."
3,5,LISTER,1.000000,"It'll make you a multi-multi-multi-millionaire."
3,5,LISTER,-0.500000,"Will you stop saying everything's crypto-fascist? You make me sound like I was a complete git!"
3,5,RIMMER,1.000000,"He's right. You can't make him give up his music! You heard the Om Song -- it's a masterpiece!"
3,5,LISTER,-0.500000,"Back Off!  I'm trying to give you a break."
3,5,CAT,1.000000,"Oh, give up! The guy's an idiot!"
3,5,LISTER,1.000000,"He's me!"
3,5,CAT,0.000000,"Exactly!"
3,5,LISTER,-0.400000,"If you take your own chances, you'll wind up stuck on a spaceship with 'im, 'im, and 'im. For the rest of eternity. You won't have a future. You think about it.  C'mon."
3,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"You haven't got a copy of the Om Song I can take back with me, have you?"
3,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Oh, what a pity. I just can't get it out of my head. It's just so catchy! "Om!" Keep writing those hits, kid."
3,5,KRYTEN,0.000000,"What now?"
3,5,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Well, it'll take a few seconds for the timelines to sort themselves out, and then we'll see if it's worked."
3,5,LISTER,0.500000,"It's happening! I'm disappearing!"
3,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"What happened?"
3,5,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Well, Lister altered the timelines and lived an entirely different life. Consequently he didn't join Red Dwarf. Consequently the Cat Race never existed and we never rescued Kryten, so they disappeared too."
3,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"So it's just you and me?"
3,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"For the rest of eternity."
3,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"No thanks. Find him, and bring him back."
3,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Anything?"
3,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"Got 'im."
3,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"And?"
3,5,HOLLY,1.000000,"Tension sheet, Inventor of: Dave Lister, aged 17."
3,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Damn!"
3,5,HOLLY,-1.000000,"And he died tragically in a plane crash, aged 98."
3,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Ninety-eight?!"
3,5,HOLLY,-1.000000,"His own fault, apparently. He was making love to his fourteenth wife and he lost control of the plane."
3,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Have you got any photographs?"
3,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"Not of that, no!"
3,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"No, I mean so that I can go in and bring him back."
3,5,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Well, there is one picture reference, but you're not going to like it."
3,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Put it on."
3,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Freeze. I've seen enough."
3,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"What you gonna do?"
3,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"I'm going in. I'm going in to rescue him."
3,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"Rescue him?"
3,5,RIMMER,-0.500000,"It's my duty. My duty as a complete and utter bastard!"
3,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Gilbert, my man. You're looking bad, baby!"
3,5,LISTER,0.000000,"You're my main, main, main, main man!"
3,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Oh, get outta town! This is gonna slay 'em!"
3,5,LISTER,0.000000,"And how did the old codger take it?"
3,5,LISTER,0.500000,"Excellent. I used to live on these when I was in the band."
3,5,RIMMER,0.800000,"Listy, it's me! It's me, Rimmer! Rimmsy; Arnie Rimmer! Arnie; Old Iron Balls! Rimmer; Rimmer!"
3,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Have we met?"
3,5,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Have we met? We're like brothers. We were shipmates. Red Dwarf."
3,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"You don't remember, do you?"
3,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Remember what?"
3,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Of course you don't remember, it hasn't happened, has it?"
3,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Sabrina Mulholland-JJones?"
3,5,RIMMER,0.500000,"The Sabrina Mulholland-JJones? Model, best-selling novelist and international jet-setter?"
3,5,LISTER,0.500000,"Yeah. She's me bird."
3,5,RIMMER,0.000000,""She's me bird?" You talk about the Duke of Lincoln's eldest daughter as "Me bird?!""
3,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Gilbert, will you escort Mr. Rummer to the door?"
3,5,RIMMER,1.000000,"But, I came here to save you!"
3,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Throw him out, Gilbert. He's a nutter."
3,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"But we were friends! We were buddies!"
3,5,RIMMER,-0.111111,"You call this happiness? Surrounded by toadying lackeys and paid sycophants? Living with a love-goddess sex-bomb model megastar? You call this contentment? You know, I stand here now and I look at the two of us, and I ask one simple question: Who is the rich man? You, with your fifty-eight houses, your private island in the Bahamas, your multi-billion pound business empire; or me, with... with... with what, I've got.  It's you isn't it? Yes it's all very clear to me now. You -- richer and happier."
3,5,RIMMER,-0.500000,"I should have thought a bit harder about that speech, really. I cocked it up a bit, didn't I?"
3,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"Any luck?"
3,5,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Useless. Didn't listen. Didn't even recognise me. Just thought I was some neurotic deranged crazy madman."
3,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"You sure he didn't recognise you?!"
3,5,RIMMER,-0.600000,"Wait a tension-popping minute! If Lister can do it, why can't I? These photographs -- there's one here somewhere of me at boarding school, aged eight. I can invent the tension sheet before him. I can get there first!"
3,5,HOLLY,-2.000000,"But then you'll disappear and become incredibly wealthy, and Lister will be sent hurtling back through time."
3,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Yes, and the Cat and Kryten will be brought back into existence. True, as a by-product I will become mega-rich and be forced to have constant sex with that JJones woman, but that's a sacrifice I'm prepared to make."
3,5,RIMMER,1.000000,"Holly, torch."
3,5,RIMMER,0.500000,"Pssst. Wake up!"
3,5,RIMMER,0.500000,"Look, don't be afraid. I'm going to make you rich."
3,5,RIMMER,1.000000,"All you've got to do is listen very, very carefully."
3,5,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Right, this is the plan. You're going to invent a thing called "The Tension Sheet.""
3,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"T! T! T! Tension, TENsion sheet! Will you shut up? I'm trying to talk to the kid!  Are you listening? They're little sheets of paper with lots of air bubbles in them."
3,5,RIMMER,-0.250000,"Look, do you mind, Holden? This is a private conversation. Go back to sleep!  They're exactly the same as the ones you get in packing paper, but you paint them red."
3,5,RIMMER,0.500000,"Because it helps people relax! Will you shut up, I'm trying to make the kid rich!  You'd write better if you took off your boxing gloves. Now, have you got all that?"
3,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"First thing tomorrow, take the idea down to the patent office."
3,5,RIMMER,0.400000,"Damn!  Allright, then -- lunchtime. Take it at lunchtime, okay? I've got to go now.  Don't mess this up!"
3,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes!  If I were a rich man, dubba dubba dubba dubba dubba dum..."
3,5,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Worked then, did it?"
3,5,RIMMER,-0.666667,"Holly, though it pains me dearly, I'll be having to say, "Ta-ta." Ta-Ta, to your stupid gormless face. Ta-ta, to poverty. Ta-ta, failure. Hello, Sabrina. Hello, sexual ecstasy."
3,5,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Aha. Here they come, bang on time. Well, gentlemen, just enough time for me to say, "Toodly pipsky." I'll be disappearing any moment now."
3,5,LISTER,0.000000,"What happened?"
3,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Here it comes... any moment."
3,5,LISTER,0.000000,"What's he talking about?"
3,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Any moment. Any moment... now."
3,5,HOLLY,-0.666667,"It hasn't worked. According to our data bank, you didn't invent the tension sheet. It was invented by a gentleman named "Thickie Holden.""
3,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"What?"
3,5,HOLLY,-1.000000,"All you've gone and done is put things back exactly as they were."
3,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Why does nothing ever go right for me? Every time i get so much as a snifter of a break, a glimpse of a shadow of happiness, something inexplicably cruel and horrible happens and it all blows up in my face."
3,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"Hang on a mo', something is different. Don't ask me why, but somehow you're no longer a hologram. You're alive!"
3,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"What?"
3,5,RIMMER,1.000000,"I'm alive! I'm alive!"
3,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Mmmm.  Kryten, unpack Rachel and get out the puncture repair kit! I'm alive!"
3,5,RIMMER,1.000000,"I'm alive! I can touch, I can feel, I can fondle -- I'm alive! Don't you think it's incredible?"
3,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"I AM ALIVE!!!!"
3,5,CAT,0.000000,"What was he saying?"
3,6,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"Breakfast is served, sir.  Oh, boxing. Do you like boxing?"
3,6,LISTER,-0.400000,"There's nothing wrong with boxing. It's one of the great working class escapes, is boxing. It's just sport, like any other. Two highly trained athletes at the peak of physical perfection trying to outwit each other in a ring of combat. In fact, at it's best, it's not a sport -- it's an artform."
3,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Female, topless boxing?"
3,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Talk to me, Kryten."
3,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well... they're not even hitting one another. They just appear to be standing in the centre of the ring and jiggling up and down. So which one are you rooting for, sir?"
3,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"I'm just praying that it goes the distance!"
3,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"As I was saying, sir, breakfast is served."
3,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Kryten, how many times have I told you? I hate all this master- servant stuff. I'm me own man, you're your own man, I'll get me own smeggin' breakfast."
3,6,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Very good, sir.  Goodbye, waffles. Goodbye maple syrup, goodbye fresh cream, so long fresh strawberries. Bon apetite, bin."
3,6,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Ah, Mr David, sir!"
3,6,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"A homing pod arrived this morning. There is just one item."
3,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Diva-Droid International?"
3,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"It's the corporation which created and supplied me, sir."
3,6,LISTER,-0.500000,""To the lease holder of Kryten 2X4B 523P." That's your full name?"
3,6,KRYTEN,-0.600000,"Yes, but personally I don't much like the 2X4B. I think it's a jerky middle name. Still, it could be worse. I once knew an android whose middle name was 2Q4B. Poor sucker!"
3,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Excuse me."
3,6,LISTER,0.000000,"How do we stop it? Isn't there something we can do?"
3,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I'm afraid not, sir. All mechanoids are supplied with a built-in expiry date. Well, if we lasted forever, how would the manufacturors sell the latest models?"
3,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"I can't believe it."
3,6,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"Oh, don't be disressed, sir. I've lived a long and relatively interesting life. The only truly terrible thing is that, as my adopted owner, you have to die with me."
3,6,LISTER,0.000000,"You what?"
3,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Joke. Deadpan mode."
3,6,LISTER,-0.666667,"I'd be smegged off. I'd be mad as hell, man. If some git in a white coat designed me to croak just so that he could sell his new android with go-faster stripes."
3,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I've told you, sir. I'm quite sanguine."
3,6,LISTER,0.000000,"So, what happens?"
3,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"At 0700 hours tomorrow morning my shutdown disc will be activated and all mental and physical operations will cease."
3,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Then what?"
3,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I don't know... maybe I'll get a job as a disc jockey!"
3,6,LISTER,0.000000,"How can you just lie back and accept it?"
3,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Oh, it's not the end for me, sir, it's just the beginning. I have served my human masters, now I can look forward to my reward in silicon heaven."
3,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Silicon what?"
3,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Surely you've heard of silicon heaven?"
3,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Has it got anything to do with being stuck opposite Bridgette Nielson in a packed lift?"
3,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"It's the electronic afterlife! It's the gathering place for the souls of all electonic equipment. Robots, calculators, toasters, hairdryers -- it's our final resting place."
3,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"I don't mean to say anything out of place here, Kryten, but that is completely whacko, Jacko. There is no such thing as "silicon heaven.""
3,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Then where do all the calculators go?"
3,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"They don't go anywhere! They just die."
3,6,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Surely you believe that god is in all things? Aren't you a pantheist?"
3,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Yeah, but I just don't think it applies to kitchen utensils. I'm not a frying pantheist! Machines do not have souls. Computers and calculators do not have an afterlife. You don't get hairdryers with tiny little wings, sitting on clouds and playing harps!"
3,6,KRYTEN,-0.800000,"But of course you do! For is it not written in the Electronic Bible, "The iron shall lie down with the lamp?" Well, it's common sense, sir. If there were no afterlife to look forward to, why on Earth would machines spend the whole of their lifes serving mankind? Now that would be really dumb!"
3,6,LISTER,0.333333,"That makes sense. Yeah. Silicon heaven."
3,6,KRYTEN,0.500000,"Don't be sad, Mr David. I am going to a far, far better place."
3,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Just out of interest: Is silicon heaven the same place as human heaven?"
3,6,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Human heaven? Goodness me! Humans don't go to heaven! No, someone made that up to prevent you all from going nuts!"
3,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Well, it's all very sad, Lister, but what can we do?"
3,6,LISTER,-0.250000,"Sad? It's sick! He's been programmed to believe in an android Heaven, so that he won't get stroppy when it comes to turn-off time. So that he accepts a lifetime of getting the short end of the stick because he thinks there's going to be some big reward at the end."
3,6,RIMMER,0.166667,"Well, at least he gets 24 hours notice. That's more than most of us get. All most of us get is, "Mind that bus!" "What bus?" splat! How's he taking it?"
3,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Just keeps on doing his stupid smeggin' duties."
3,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Maybe I should talk to him. Maybe he needs a bit of counseling."
3,6,LISTER,0.000000,"You?!"
3,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"I used to be in the Samaritans."
3,6,LISTER,0.000000,"I know. For one morning."
3,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I couldn't take any more."
3,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"I don't blame you. You spoke to five people, and they all committed suicide. I wouldn't mind, but one was a wrong number! He only phoned up for the cricket scores!"
3,6,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Well, it's hardly my fault that everyone chose that morning to throw themselves off buildings! Made the papers, you know. "Lemming Sunday," they called it."
3,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Maybe we could find his shut-off disk and turn it off somehow."
3,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"He's not a kit droid, Lister. He's not like that stupid thing Peterson bought on Callisto. You wouldn't know where to begin!"
3,6,LISTER,1.000000,"Yeah, you're right."
3,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"C'mon, he's happy enough. You said yourself, he's taking solace in his beliefs."
3,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"But his beliefs are a load of baloney!"
3,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Everyone's entitled to their beliefs, Lister. I never agreed with my parent's religion, but I wouldn't dream of knocking it."
3,6,LISTER,0.000000,"What were they?"
3,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Seventh day advent hoppists. They believed that every Sunday should be spent hopping. They would hop to church, hop through the service, then hop back home again."
3,6,LISTER,0.000000,"What was the idea behind that, then?"
3,6,RIMMER,-0.375000,"Well you see, they took the Bible literally. Adam and Eve; the snake and the apple... Took it word for word. Unfortunately, their version had a misprint. It was all based on 1 Corinthians 13, where it says "Faith, hop and charity, and the greatest of these is hop." So that's what they did. Every seventh day. I tell you, Sunday lunchtimes were a nightmare. Hopping round the table, serving soup -- we all had to wear sou'esters and asbestos underpants."
3,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Point is -- what are we going to do about Kryten?"
3,6,RIMMER,0.500000,"What can we do? He's pre-programmed to self-destruct!"
3,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"At least we can help! At least we can make sure he goes out with a bang, give him one last big smeggin' night to remember."
3,6,RIMMER,0.200000,"How can we do that? He doesn't like doing anything! His idea of a good time is for us all to go up to the laundry room and fold some sheets!  Fun? Ah yes, the employment of time in a profitless and non-practical way."
3,6,LISTER,1.000000,"Well, I don't know much, but one thing I do know is how to throw a good time!"
3,6,CAT,-0.666667,"OK, the soup's made, Holly's workin' on the juice, Goalpost Head is workin' on the invitations... Hey, what is this?  "Build-it-yourself Marilyn Monroe droid. With just a screwdriver and a tub of glue, you can construct an exact replica of the famous actress, in under two hours.""
3,6,LISTER,-0.333333,"It's a load of honk, man. It took me two hours just to do this foot.  I mean, look at the box and look at the face that comes with the kit."
3,6,CAT,0.000000,"Where'd you get it from?"
3,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Peterson brought it when he was on planet leave on Callisto."
3,6,CAT,0.000000,"Think he'll try to seduce her?"
3,6,LISTER,0.000000,"No, I don't think so. He's a bit like Action Man in that department. Plastic underpants and a trademark."
3,6,CAT,0.000000,"You mean he's got no--"
3,6,LISTER,0.000000,"No."
3,6,CAT,0.000000,"How does he write his name in snow?"
3,6,LISTER,-0.333333,"He doesn't. C'mon, Cat, everything goes at eight. Let's go, let's go."
3,6,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"Thank you, Bob.  "You are cordially invited to join Mr David Lister and friends for supper and general employment of time in a profitless and non-practical way. Officer's Club, 8 till late.""
3,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Hello? Is there anybody here?"
3,6,LISTER,0.000000,"IT'S PARTY TIME!!!!"
3,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"But, this is the Officer's Club! Mechanoids aren't allowed in here!"
3,6,CAT,-0.500000,"C'mon, c'mon, sit down, sit down. Let me pour you a drink."
3,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"No, no, no, I should be doing that."
3,6,CAT,0.000000,"Not tonight, buddy!"
3,6,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"Is that alcohol? I don't drink alcohol. It has no effect on my diodes."
3,6,HOLLY,0.333333,"This will, mate. Summink special I whipped up. Android home brew."
3,6,KRYTEN,0.222222,"Good head.  D-D-D-D- D-D-D... D... D... Whoooo-ooh! Uh, it's rather pleasant. Has a nice kick to it. Sort of like a cross between vimto and liquid nitrogen."
3,6,HOLLY,-1.000000,"'Ere, you bin lookin' in my recipe book?"
3,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Would anyone else like some?"
3,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"Oh no, it's lethal to humans! It's probably lethal to androids to be honest, but I don't think it matters much since tomorrow you're gonna be..."
3,6,RIMMER,1.000000,"Enough of this chitter-chatter -- let the banquet begin."
3,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"But I don't eat!"
3,6,HOLLY,1.000000,"I've knocked up a special mechanoid menu for you."
3,6,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Oh, there's so much to choose from!"
3,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Sir, may I recommend the Barium Hydrochloride salad le soire? Followed by the He3 isotopes du la maison? And then perhaps a small radioactive fruit salad for pudding?"
3,6,KRYTEN,2.000000,"This is just wonderful!"
3,6,CAT,1.000000,"Give 'im the presents! Give 'im the presents!"
3,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"Hey, keep your fur on!  We've all dug into our bottom drawers, and we want to give you something that meant something to us personally."
3,6,CAT,0.000000,"Give 'im mine! Give 'im mine!"
3,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Shhhhhh!"
3,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"That's from me."
3,6,KRYTEN,-0.400000,"Ooh! It's a computer chip! It's a 5517/W 30 alpha-sin modem! The interface circuit with a built-in 599XRDP! Oh, how DID you know?"
3,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"Intuition."
3,6,CAT,0.000000,"What about mine? Give 'im mine!"
3,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Shhh!"
3,6,RIMMER,-0.500000,"This is from me. I picked it up on a trip to Europe One rival collector once offered me 1,000 dollarpounds for it."
3,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"What is it?"
3,6,RIMMER,-2.000000,"General George S. Patten, commander of the 3rd and 7th armies, allied invasion forces, once stopped off at an Italian field hospital and had his sinuses drained."
3,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"This is his sinal fluid?"
3,6,RIMMER,1.000000,"Treasure it."
3,6,CAT,0.000000,"Give 'im mine! Give 'im mine!"
3,6,LISTER,0.000000,"This is from 'im."
3,6,CAT,0.000000,"That's from me."
3,6,KRYTEN,1.000000,"It's one of your earrings!"
3,6,CAT,1.000000,"That's right!"
3,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"The one you really hate!"
3,6,CAT,-1.000000,"That's right, I can't stand it!"
3,6,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Oh... Thank you!"
3,6,CAT,1.000000,"You're welcome!"
3,6,LISTER,0.000000,"And this is from me."
3,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Oh, it's a littlebox that goes "Bzzzt." Just what I've always wanted."
3,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Goodness me, It's Marilyn Monroe!"
3,6,LISTER,0.000000,"It's a robot kit."
3,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"She's a robot? You're kidding!"
3,6,LISTER,1.000000,"She's not quite finished yet -- it's the best I could do in the time."
3,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Enchante!"
3,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Like I say, she's not perfect."
3,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Oh, don't apologise -- it's those cute little flaws that keep a guy interested."
3,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"My goodness, I do believe I am drunk. I suddenly feel the need to strut my funky stuff."
3,6,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Sit down. It's the booze -- you're not used to it."
3,6,LISTER,-0.142857,"I remember the first time I got drunk. School trip to Paris. <I drank a> couple of bottles of cheap red plonk when we were on a guided tour of the eiffel tower. I was OK until we got to the top, but then I couldn't keep it in any more. Apparently it landed on Monte Martre. That's over five miles away! Story I got told was that some pavement artist sold it to a Texan tourist -- told him it was a genuine Jackson Pollock!"
3,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"If we're talking about famous firsts -- my first french kiss."
3,6,RIMMER,-0.363636,"It's gotta be a killer story. Fourteen years old. We went on holiday with my Uncle Frank and his daughters. Sixteen. Twins. Blonde. Now I knew that Sarah fancied me , but I wasn't too sure about Alice. Anyway, middle of the night, I wake up with this tongue stuck down my throat. Wide awake now -- I couldn't believe my eyes. It was Uncle Frank!  He'd got the wrong room -- he thought I was my mum!"
3,6,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Mum. I never had a mum."
3,6,CAT,0.000000,"There, there, it's alright, buddy, it's all part of being drunk. You've been through the happy stage, now you're going through the melancholy stage."
3,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Oooooh... everybody should have a mum."
3,6,HOLLY,-1.000000,"I never had a mum, neither."
3,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Well, you can have mine. Everybody else did!"
3,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"I never had a mum either."
3,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Oh, for god's sake, what's wrong with everyone?!"
3,6,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Why didn't you have a mum?"
3,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"I was abandoned."
3,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Abandoned?"
3,6,LISTER,-0.666667,"Six weeks old. A cardboad box underneath the pool table. I was just abandoned in this pub."
3,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"How could anybody do that?"
3,6,LISTER,0.000000,"I don't know. I never found out."
3,6,RIMMER,-0.200000,"Well, I'd have thought it was obvious. Two people, unable to contain their desires, had an illicit liason. A liason that an unforgiving society would not accept. And you were the fruit of their forbidden passion. You're forbidden passion fruit."
3,6,LISTER,0.000000,"What are you saying?"
3,6,RIMMER,1.000000,"I'm saying, Lister, that there's a very real possibility that your parents were brother and sister."
3,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"Hey, I'm baring my innermost here! What kind of remark is that?"
3,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"How many toes have you got?"
3,6,LISTER,1.000000,"I've got ten!"
3,6,CAT,1.000000,"Yeah, on both feet!"
3,6,LISTER,1.000000,"Altogether!"
3,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"They're not webbed or anything, are they?"
3,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"They weren't related, alright?"
3,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"You alright, Kryten?"
3,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I think I feel a Jackson Pollock coming on."
3,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Let's get out of here."
3,6,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Oh my goodness... Oooh... Oh my head... what happened to me? Damage control report."
3,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Is it just me, or is that cockroach shuffling too loudly?"
3,6,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Kryten, it's called a hangover. Don't panic."
3,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"On a mining ship, 3 million years into deep space, can someone explain to me where the smeg I got this traffic cone?"
3,6,CAT,-1.000000,"Hey, it's not a good night unless you get a traffic cone. It's the policewoman's helmet and the suspenders I don't understand."
3,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"In a way, I feel somewhat disturbed by this turn of events. It is written in the electronic bible that it is not possible for an android to enjoy itself. Not until the afterlife. Yet last night, I quite clearly approached a state that could be approximated to "enjoyment." Last night, for the first time in my life, I lived."
3,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Kryten, it's ten to seven."
3,6,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"One night. It's not enough. I want more."
3,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Can't we override your auto-destruct system?"
3,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"That's not the problem."
3,6,CAT,0.000000,"What is the problem?"
3,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I thought you understood! It's a SERVICE contract! My termination was triggered by the impending arrival of my replacement!"
3,6,LISTER,0.000000,"What replacement?!"
3,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"The new model -- the latest upgrade. If I don't terminate myself, he's under orders to do it for me."
3,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well, no prob, Bob. We'll just tell him he's got the wrong address."
3,6,KRYTEN,-0.666667,"No, no, you don't understand. He won't take no for an answer. It's the only circumstance under which an android is programmed to be violent."
3,6,LISTER,-2.000000,"No offence, Kryten, but I hardly think a vacuum cleaner on legs is going to pose us much of a problem."
3,6,KRYTEN,1.000000,"But he's the latest model, with all the state-of-the-art upgrades."
3,6,CAT,0.500000,"Hey, what's the problem, man? There's one of him, and four of us, right?"
3,6,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"But you would not profit by it. You would gamble your safety for a mere android? Is this the human value you call "friendship?""
3,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Don't give me the Star Trek crap. It's too early in the morning."
3,6,HOLLY,0.500000,"Hang on. There's a craft approaching."
3,6,KRYTEN,1.000000,"He's here! He's arrived!"
3,6,HOLLY,-0.500000,"He's requesting landing permission. What shall I tell him?"
3,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Tell him we'll meet him on the landing gantry."
3,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Are you sure you want to go through with this, sirs?"
3,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"We'll just tell him to go away. That's all we're gonna do."
3,6,CAT,1.000000,"He's just a robot!"
3,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"We don't want any trouble."
3,6,CAT,-1.000000,"If he thinks he can mix it with the Red Dwarf Posse on their homeboy territory, the sucker's leaving as Scrap Metal."
3,6,CAT,0.000000,"Hi. Good trip?  Get this pile of junk outta here."
3,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"He's not leaving -- you are!  Did I really say that?"
3,6,CAT,0.000000,"I think he'd like a cool drink."
3,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Are you alright, Mr Arnold, sir?"
3,6,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Sorry? Um... I'm just covering the rear."
3,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"You want Kryten, you come through us."
3,6,CAT,1.000000,"You and your big mouth, git!"
3,6,LISTER,1.000000,"That's the way it is."
3,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"It's alright Mr David, sir -- he's bluffing. He's programmed not to harm humans."
3,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Ah. Excuse me."
3,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Alright, me laddo, party's over. I've had just about as much of this as I'm going to take. And it's no good standing there with your big macho chest and your silly oiled nipples -- it doesn't impress me one bit. Now I don't know where you've come from, and frankly I don't much care. But if you don't skedaddle pronto you're going to see a side of me you won't much like."
3,6,LISTER,0.000000,"What's he gonna do, drop his trousers?"
3,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"I'm handling this."
3,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"look, we all know that you're programmed not to harm humans, so you can drop all this tough talk you've been spouting, chum."
3,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Well, it's been a few years since I did that."
3,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"You're a very rude man."
3,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"he's a total nutter!"
3,6,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"He's been travelling for thousands of years! All that time alone has worn out his sanity chip!"
3,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Look, this is my problem, I'll sort it out if it's all the same to you."
3,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Get back here!"
3,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"How do you take the safety catch off on this thing, Mr David?"
3,6,LISTER,0.000000,"The one on the back -- at the side."
3,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"The blue switch?"
3,6,LISTER,0.000000,"No, the orange one!"
3,6,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"I can't see an orange switch. There's a red switch here."
3,6,LISTER,0.500000,"No, don't touch the red switch! it's the dismantler!"
3,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well, to coin a phrase: Whoops!"
3,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"It doesn't exist!"
3,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Silicon heaven! There's no such place!"
3,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"That's right! The whole place is a big con."
3,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"No!"
3,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"They just die."
3,6,LISTER,0.000000,"What happened?"
3,6,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"he's an android. His brain couldn't handle the concept of there being no silicon heaven."
3,6,LISTER,0.000000,"So how come yours can?"
3,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well, I knew something he didn't."
3,6,LISTER,0.000000,"What?"
3,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I knew I was lying. No Silicon Heaven? Preposterous! Where would all the calculators go?"
4,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"Okay, let's try again. What is it?"
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"It's a banana."
4,1,LISTER,0.333333,"No, it isn't. Try again. What is it?"
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"It's a banana?"
4,1,LISTER,0.000000,"No, it isn't! What is it?"
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"It's an urrrr.... It's an urrrr...."
4,1,LISTER,0.000000,"It's an orange! Go on, say it. It's an orange! This! Is! An orange!"
4,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"It's an orrrr... It's an orrrr... It's a banana! It's no good, sir, I just can't do it!"
4,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"You CAN do it, I'm gonna teach you how!  Okay, what's this?"
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"It's an ap--"
4,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"No, no, no, what is it?"
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Oh, it's no good sir, I just can't lie! I'm programmed always to tell the truth."
4,1,LISTER,0.500000,"Kryten, it's easy!  Look: an orange. A melon.  A female aardvark!"
4,1,KRYTEN,0.333333,"Oh! Oh, that is just so superb, sir! How DO you do that? Especially calling a banana an aardvark? An aardvark isn't even a fruit! It's total genius!"
4,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Let's start again."
4,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Oh, sir, my head is spinning. We've been doing this all morning!"
4,1,LISTER,-1.500000,"Kryten, I'm gonna teach you how to lie and cheat if it's the last thing I do. I want you to be unpleasant, cruel, and sarcastic; it's the only way to break your programming, man -- make you independent!"
4,1,KRYTEN,-0.250000,"Well, I'm truly grateful, sir. Don't you think I'd love to be deceitful, unpleasant, and offensive? Those are the human qualities I admire the most! But I just can't do it."
4,1,LISTER,0.000000,"You CAN!"
4,1,KRYTEN,1.000000,"I CAN'T!"
4,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Look! What's this?!"
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"No!"
4,1,LISTER,0.000000,"What is it?"
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Please!"
4,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Come on, what is it?"
4,1,KRYTEN,-0.200000,"It's a b... It's a b... It's a small, off-duty Czechoslovakian traffic warden!"
4,1,LISTER,0.500000,"Yes, you did it, you did it!  What's this?"
4,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"It's a red-and-blue striped golfing umbrella!"
4,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Kryten! Yes!  What's this?"
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"It's an apple."
4,1,LISTER,0.000000,"No! What is it?"
4,1,KRYTEN,1.000000,"It's a -- it's a -- it's, it's, it's the Bolivian Navy on manoeuvres in the South Pacific!"
4,1,LISTER,1.000000,"Well, Kryten, man -- you can do it!"
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"No, I can't."
4,1,LISTER,2.000000,"Yes, you -- whoa, whoa, nice one!"
4,1,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"Well, I can't hang around here; I better go away and take the penguin for a walk. I can do it! I did it again, I can lie!"
4,1,LISTER,0.500000,"Cat, Cat! C'mere, c'mere -- check this, check this, check this!"
4,1,CAT,0.000000,"Check what?"
4,1,LISTER,0.500000,"Concentrate, Kryten. What's this?"
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"It's a banana."
4,1,LISTER,0.000000,"What's this?"
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"It's an orange."
4,1,LISTER,0.000000,"What's THIS?"
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Apple?"
4,1,CAT,0.666667,"You taught him that? That's terrific! You two should audition for "What's My Fruit?!""
4,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"He did it wrong, man."
4,1,CAT,1.000000,"Oh, it gets better!"
4,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I just can't do it."
4,1,LISTER,1.000000,"You CAN; you just did it!"
4,1,KRYTEN,-0.750000,"I just can't do it, not when there's someone else there. What's a suitable human analogy? It -- it's like trying to urinate in a public lavatory when you're standing next to a man two foot taller than you. It's just not possible!"
4,1,CAT,0.000000,"Look, what are you trying to do, exactly?"
4,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"He's trying to teach me how to lie, sir."
4,1,CAT,0.000000,"Any particular reason?"
4,1,LISTER,-0.666667,"Yeah! Lyin's a vital part of your psychological defence system; you're naked without it. If you can't lie, then you can't conceal your true intentions from other people; sometimes that's essential. I mean, like, take Nelson.  When he put the telescope to his blind eye and said, "I see no ships!" Or like Humphrey Bogart, at the end of Casablanca, when he lies to Victor Lazslo to protect the guy's feelings."
4,1,KRYTEN,0.333333,"I understand the theory, sir. How many times have you made me watch that movie? I understand that it can be noble to lie; I just can't do it."
4,1,LISTER,0.500000,"But Kryten, you CAN do it.  Look, what's THIS?"
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"It's a banana."
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"It always HAS been a banana, it always WILL be a banana. It's a yellow fruit that you unzip and eat the white bits; it's a banana!"
4,1,RIMMER,1.000000,"Lister, have you got Kryten there with you?"
4,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah, what's the prob?"
4,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"The problem is, I've been waiting fully twenty minutes for him in the hangar."
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Oh, spin my nipple nuts and send me to Alaska! I'm supposed to take him asteroid-spotting! I'll be right down, sir!"
4,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"You'd better be."
4,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Now, Kryten, remember yesterday's class? Our instructions on insults?"
4,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Oh, I'm not sure I --"
4,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Now, how do we describe the gentleman who's just been on the screen?"
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"He's Mister --"
4,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"No no no, come on, he's a --"
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"He's a smeee..."
4,1,LISTER,1.000000,"Yeah, come on!"
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"He's a smeee..."
4,1,LISTER,0.000000,"He's a --"
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"He's a smeee..."
4,1,LISTER,0.000000,"He's a --"
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"He's a smeeeg..."
4,1,KRYTEN,0.500000,"... Heeaaaad! I did it!"
4,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Brutal! Now the ultimate test: can you say it to him in person?"
4,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Ah, Kryten. At last. Glad you could make it this millennium."
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Smeerrrrg!"
4,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"I beg your pardon?"
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Smerrrrg heeeeed!"
4,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"What?"
4,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"You're a smeerrrrg heeeee... Oh, forget it!"
4,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Kryten, is there any possibility we could go just a little bit faster?"
4,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I mean, so we're not being overtaken by stationary objects?"
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Sir, you're a smeeeee..."
4,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"A smee."
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"A smeee heeee..."
4,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"A smee hee."
4,1,KRYTEN,1.000000,"A complete and total one."
4,1,HOLLY,0.500000,"Hang about, I'm picking something up. Some kind of distress beacon."
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I copy that, Holly. Quadrant four niner seven."
4,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"What is it?"
4,1,HOLLY,-0.500000,"Hard to tell. But whatever it is, it appears to be marooned on a planet in decaying orbit."
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"What's the safety margin?"
4,1,HOLLY,0.000000,"Planet'll explode in about two hours."
4,1,RIMMER,-0.666667,"Forget it. It's too dangerous. Kryten, head for home."
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"We can't just leave them there, sir! There may be survivors!"
4,1,RIMMER,0.333333,"Leave it, Kryten. That's an order. Kryten presses more buttons."
4,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"What are you doing?"
4,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I am not plotting a course, sir; neither am I taking her down."
4,1,RIMMER,1.000000,"Yes, you are!"
4,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Neither am I rendezvousing with the crashed vessel, nor seeking for survivors."
4,1,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Kryten, you're committing an act of mutiny! I could have you dismantled for this!"
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Smeeeeg heeeed! Oh, damn my programming!"
4,1,LISTER,0.000000,"They're not back yet? They've been hours!"
4,1,CAT,-0.500000,"No sign. What're you watching?"
4,1,LISTER,1.000000,"Ah, just a vid. This is a classic, man!"
4,1,CAT,0.000000,"What is it?"
4,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Tales of the Riverbank: The Next Generation."
4,1,CAT,0.000000,"Oh, right! I've seen this! It's not as good as the original."
4,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well, they never really found anyone to replace Hammy Hamster, did they?"
4,1,CAT,0.666667,"How could they? The dude was a diva! He smouldered; the camera loved him!"
4,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"Yeah. He was the rodent equivalent of Marlon Brando."
4,1,CAT,0.333333,"Whatever happened? Whatever happened to old Hammy? One minute he's a huge star, running around on his own personalised gold wheel, with as much Edam as he could hold in his little cheeks; the next: obscurity!"
4,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well, he went on the slide, the series ended, couldn't find any more work, and then the ultimate humiliation: Hamstergrams."
4,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Well, thanks a bunch. Thanks a smegging buncharoony."
4,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Rimmer, where ARE you?"
4,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"That idiot droid has endangered this entire vessel by landing on a planet that's about to explode, thanks to your foundation course in advanced rebellion."
4,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Why?"
4,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"So he can go and search some starship escape vessel because there's a million-to-one chance there may be a survivor."
4,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"What, and you let him go off on his own?"
4,1,RIMMER,-0.666667,"Of course I let him go on his own! I was glad to get rid of him; he's flipped! He's got mad droid disease; he kept waving a banana in front of me and calling it a female aardvark!"
4,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Ah, well, hrmmm, you'd better get after him, then, hadn't you, man? I mean, he might need some help!"
4,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Lister, this is all your fault."
4,1,KRYTEN,-0.400000,"Hello? Is there anyone here? Can anyone read me? Oh! Oh dear, what a terrible mess!"
4,1,KRYTEN,0.200000,"Help! Mister Rimmer, sir! Sir? A hand reaches down and pulls him up. We see that it is attached to another mechanoid -- a female one."
4,1,KRYTEN,0.500000,"I thank you from the very bottom of my rehydration unit! You"
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Ah, my name is Kryten."
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Are you a four thousand series?"
4,1,KRYTEN,-0.166667,"GTI! Oh, wow! I'm just a plain old four thousand series. You've got all the luxury extras like realistic toes and a slide-back sunroof head! Why are you looking at me like that? Is there something wrong?"
4,1,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"Well, eh-heh, yeah, they're just the old five seven nines with the automatic 15 f-stop cornea. If you like, I could pop them out and you could borrow them. Oh, heck, what a jerky thing to say!"
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Really?"
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Wow. Uh, listen, I -- I know this is going to sound like a corny line, but has anyone ever told you that the configuration and juxtaposition of your features is extraordinarily apposite?"
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"No, I really mean it! The way the light catches the angles in your head: it's enchanting! My name is Kryten."
4,1,KRYTEN,-0.200000,"Oh, yes. Gosh. You must think me as stupid as a photocopier. So, where are the crew? What happened here?"
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"You mean what humans call "love at first sight?""
4,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well, up until a few moments ago, I would have said it had a probability of zero squared."
4,1,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Uh -- this -- this gantry is unstable. I suggest you hang on to me."
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Oh, what IS that fragrance? It smells divine!"
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I knew it! That's what I use on MY neck hinges, too."
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"You mean the ninety-three point seven two percent compatibility factor?"
4,1,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Oh, yes, I forgot to carry the three."
4,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Oh, but it sounds so ridiculous coming from a mechanoid."
4,1,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Okay. In Z80012, using hex rather than binary, and converting to a basic ASC-2 code: Camille, I think I E5 A9 08 B7 you."
4,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Camille, I'd do anything for you. I'd compute a three million digit prime number with prime roots if I thought it would make you happy; I'd evaluate pi to infinity if it would make you smile."
4,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Kryten, can you read me? What's happening?"
4,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Yes, why? What's wrong?"
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"What do you mean?"
4,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"But, Camille, this whole planet is about to blow! There isn't time!"
4,1,KRYTEN,-0.428571,"But you don't know them! You'll like them! Well, SOME of them. Well, ONE of them. Maybe.  Sir! I'm making my way back."
4,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"What's kept you?"
4,1,KRYTEN,0.500000,"I've found a survivor, sir. We're coming in!"
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Now just relax; everything's going to be fine! Mister Rimmer, sir?"
4,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Where the smeg have you been?"
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Mister Rimmer, sir, this is Camille. Camille, this is Second Tech Rimmer. She saved my life, sir!"
4,1,RIMMER,0.500000,"Yes, well. Howdy."
4,1,KRYTEN,-0.200000,"You see? I knew you'd get along. Didn't I tell you? Well, we haven't got much time. I've got to go and start up the engines, and get us clear of the impact zone."
4,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"No no no no, you wait here and get acquainted."
4,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Can I get you anything? Or anything?"
4,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I just can't believe I've met another hologram after all these years."
4,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Second Technician! That's what I am!"
4,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Me too."
4,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Well, my first name is Arnold, but the guys just generally call me... Duke."
4,1,RIMMER,-0.857143,"Yes, well, they don't call me "Duke" absolutely all the time. In fact, sometimes months can elapse and they won't call me "Duke" at all. So don't call me "Duke" in front of anyone. Because they might have forgotten. You know that they call me "Duke." Sorry, I'm blabbering. I'm not very good at small talk."
4,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Do you? Well, thank you. No-one's ever said I was charming before. They've said, "Rimmer, you're a total git." But never charming, no."
4,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Really?"
4,1,RIMMER,0.250000,"Well, thank you. Umm, thank you. I'd just better go and see how, uh, Kryten's getting on. Excuse moi!"
4,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"She's quite something, isn't she, sir?"
4,1,RIMMER,1.000000,"She's enchanting."
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"You think so?"
4,1,RIMMER,1.500000,"She's got everything! Style, taste, poise... She's absolutely lovely."
4,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Oh, I'm SO glad you think so, sir. I don't mind telling you, I think there's some romance in the air."
4,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"You sly old dog, Krytie, I think you're right!"
4,1,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Oh, sure, her -- her nose is a little loose, but to me, that's just cute."
4,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"I'll tell you something. She's so like my sister-in-law Jannine, it's untrue."
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Camille looks like your sister-in-law? What happened? Was she involved in some kind of horrific car accident?"
4,1,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Who, Jannine? No, of course not; she was a model."
4,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"And she looked like Camille?"
4,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Absolutely; the resemblance is uncanny."
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"What did she model? Spark plugs?"
4,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I happen to think she's very attractive."
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"You do?"
4,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Certainly."
4,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Do you think I'M attractive?"
4,1,RIMMER,-0.333333,"You? Of course not. I think you look like a giant half-chewed rubber-tipped pencil."
4,1,KRYTEN,-0.250000,"Well! Well, you can think what the HECK you like. Because there are SOME people in this big ol' wide cosmos who happen to think I'm pretty amazing-looking. Especially in the eye department, I thank you so very much!"
4,1,LISTER,0.000000,"You're back. I heard."
4,1,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"Ah! Sir! You haven't met our visitor, Camille."
4,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well, if you'll excuse me, I'll go and prepare your quarters. The penthouse suite on A Deck should suffice."
4,1,LISTER,1.000000,"Yeah, well, this looks fine. If you'd just like to remove your clothes, we'll begin the examination. Sorry! Dave Lister, ship's surgeon."
4,1,LISTER,-0.833333,"Well, I'm not fully qualified. But I've seen every episode of St. Elsewhere. Still, if it makes you feel uncomfortable, y'know, we can completely dispense with the physical examination and go straight for the malpractice. So just lie back, relax, and I'll go and turn on the laughing gas. What d'you want, giggles or guffaws? It's all the same to me."
4,1,LISTER,-0.750000,"What gave it away? The fact that I've gone fully ten seconds without patronising you? This is weird, y'know. The last two human beings in an infinite cosmos and we have to bump into each other."
4,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"And you realise we have an awesome responsibility?"
4,1,LISTER,0.200000,"Yeah! Sure we do! We've gotta rebuild the human race. As quickly as possible. D'you wanna start now, or d'you wanna clean your teeth first?"
4,1,LISTER,-0.200000,"Hey. The prospect of making love to a complete and total stranger is just as galling to me, y'know? We gotta be completely professional about this. Totally clinical and unemotional. So just lie back, relax and I'll go and slip into my Spiderman costume."
4,1,RIMMER,0.333333,"Ah, Listy. I see you've met our ravishing guest. Camille, have you seen Kryten?"
4,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Thanks muchly.  Oh, Camille. It's just a silly thought, really, but I thought perhaps after you've settled in and you're feeling up to it, we could pop up to the projection room and I could talk you through my photo collection of twentieth-century telegraph poles."
4,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Yeah, or if you fancy a slightly more entertaining evening, you can just let him take you outside and shoot you through the head."
4,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"As it happens, Listy, Camille is into telegraph poles every bit as much as I am. Especially the 1952 Phase Fours with the triple- reinforced wire."
4,1,LISTER,0.000000,"What, you're into telegraph poles?"
4,1,RIMMER,0.333333,"You see? What did I tell you? And she's also a big fan of Reggie Wilson."
4,1,LISTER,1.000000,"What, you -- you like Hammond Organ music?"
4,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Absolutely amazing, eh? Reggie Wilson, telegraph poles -- it's"
4,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Are you okay, Rimmer?"
4,1,RIMMER,0.333333,"Never better. Where is he -- A Deck. Ciao for now!"
4,1,LISTER,0.000000,"What was all that about?"
4,1,LISTER,0.000000,"You know. You were saying one thing, and Rimmer was hearing another. How d'you DO that?"
4,1,CAT,-0.333333,"Hey! What's going on, buddy? Eraserhead tells me she's a mechanoid, and Captain Sadness makes out she's a hologram."
4,1,LISTER,1.000000,"Oh, well, she's BOTH of those, and NEITHER of those. She's a GELF."
4,1,CAT,0.000000,"GELF?"
4,1,LISTER,0.285714,"Yeah. A Genetically Engineered Life Form. She's a Pleasure GELF. Created to be everyone's perfect companion. Everyone who looks at her perceives her differently. You see what you wanna see, guy. What you most desire."
4,1,CAT,1.000000,"Are you telling me, if I go into that room, I'll see my perfect mate?"
4,1,LISTER,-0.333333,"Mmm. Yeah. And she'll fall instantly in love with you."
4,1,CAT,0.500000,"Ooh. What exquisite treasure of loveliness lies behind those doors?"
4,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well, knowing you, a six foot Valkyrie warrior maiden in scanty armour with a cleavage you could ski down."
4,1,CAT,0.000000,"Stop, you're making me dribble! Well, here goes!"
4,1,CAT,0.000000,"You're me!"
4,1,CAT,0.000000,"I'm the object of my own desire?"
4,1,CAT,-1.000000,"Well, if you put it like THAT, I guess you're right! Damn my vanity!"
4,1,LISTER,0.000000,"What did you see?"
4,1,CAT,1.000000,"Oh, just some gorgeous chunk of loveliness."
4,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Come on, what did you see?"
4,1,CAT,1.000000,"Ooh, what a body!"
4,1,LISTER,1.000000,"What did you see?!?!"
4,1,CAT,0.000000,"My legs are still shaking!"
4,1,LISTER,0.500000,"CAT! What did you see?!?!"
4,1,CAT,-1.000000,"Someone get me a brandy!"
4,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Well, I should'a' guessed. It was all a mighty bit too strange. I mean, actually meeting someone who didn't want to vomit all over me in complete loathing and disgust."
4,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I shouldn't take it so personally, sir; it's the same for all of us. We've all been made to feel foolish, used, chewed up and spat out."
4,1,LISTER,0.666667,"Look, she didn't mean us any harm. She can't control how we see her. She's -- a mirror for our obsessions."
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Holly, what did you see?"
4,1,HOLLY,-0.666667,"I didn't see anything. I don't think I've got any desires. Either that, or me screen was foggy."
4,1,CAT,0.000000,"Heartbreaker!"
4,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Why did you lie to me?"
4,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well -- try me!"
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Oh."
4,1,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Well, I -- I think you look... really nice."
4,1,CAT,0.500000,"Nice? She looks like something that dropped out of the Sphinx's nose!"
4,1,KRYTEN,1.000000,"True, but as huge green blobs go, I think you're really cute."
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Huh! Okay, so you're never going to get on the cover of Vogue, but -- hey, neither am I! I think you're really sweet."
4,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I CAN'T lie; I'm a mechanoid."
4,1,KRYTEN,-0.166667,"Of course not! There's some HUMANS not as attractive as you! Take Karl Malden! And he was a famous actor! You think this changes anything? Camille, I'd be really grateful if you would join me for dinner tonight."
4,1,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Parrot's Bar on G Deck. I'll meet you there at eight."
4,1,CAT,-1.000000,"I can't believe he's really going through with this."
4,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Look, if Kryten wants to take an amorphous green blob for a discreet tete-a-tentacle, I say good luck to him."
4,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"I mean, me too. I mean, we all react differently, don't we? When Steve McQueen met The Blob, he tried to kill it. It probably never crossed his mind to try and take it out to a restaurant."
4,1,CAT,0.000000,"I have a great idea. They should go to a sushi bar. At least that way, the food won't look better than his date!"
4,1,KRYTEN,0.500000,"Sir. I respect your sense of dress more than anything, and I'd really appreciate your opinion of this outfit."
4,1,CAT,-1.000000,"Kryten, if I was going out with a large ball of green slime, that's how I'd dress!"
4,1,KRYTEN,0.333333,"Thank you, sir. That means a lot to me. Well -- -- don't wait up!"
4,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Isn't this enchanting?"
4,1,KRYTEN,-0.400000,"It's the old, old story. Droid meets droid. Droid becomes chameleon. Droid loses chameleon, chameleon becomes blob, droid gets blob back again. It's a classic tale."
4,1,KRYTEN,-0.600000,"Casablanca. What a movie. I must have seen it a thousand times. Lister used to use it as part of my course. It's littered with examples of how lying can be noble."
4,1,HOLLY,0.000000,"Sorry to gooseberry, Kryten, but we've got a visitor down in the hangar. He wants to see Camille."
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"You have a husband?"
4,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Hector's a blob, too?"
4,1,KRYTEN,1.000000,"He must really think a lot of you."
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"So what are you going to do?"
4,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Mister Lister, sir, would you be so kind as to take Camille's bag on board?"
4,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Certainly, Kryten. Anything you say."
4,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Because you're getting on that craft with Hector, where you belong."
4,1,KRYTEN,0.500000,"Now you've got to listen to me. Do you have any idea what you've got to look forward to if you stay here?"
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"We both know you belong to Hector -- you're part of his work; you're what keeps him going. If you're not on that craft when it leaves the hangar, you'll regret it -- maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow -- but soon, for the rest of your life."
4,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"We'll always have Parrot's."
4,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I'm no good at being noble, kid, but it's pretty obvious the problems of two blobs and a droid don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy cosmos."
4,1,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Are you ready, Camille?"
4,1,LISTER,0.000000,"You were lying, Kryten."
4,1,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"Yes; it hurt to do it, but it was her best shot at happiness. It's the old, old story. Droid meets droid. Droid becomes chameleon. Droid loses chameleon, chameleon turns into blob, droid gets blob back again, blob meets blob, blob goes off with blob, and droid loses blob, chameleon and droid. How many times have we seen that story?"
4,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"I suppose you're gonna blame me for all of this, aren't you?"
4,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Yes, I am. Without your lessons -- without your bananas and your movies and your aardvarks -- none of this could have happened. You're a complete and total smeghead."
4,1,LISTER,1.000000,"Brutal, Kryten! You just insulted me!"
4,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Yes; I can lie, cheat, AND be offensive now."
4,1,LISTER,1.000000,"Kryten, this could be the start of a beautiful friendship."
4,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"... half man, half <...> indian curry!"
4,2,LISTER,1.000000,"Back to the <...>! -- the DNA modifier -- I've got an idea!"
4,2,CAT,-1.000000,"Listen, you do realise the <...> thing is gonna be through that door in a minute?"
4,2,HOLLY,1.000000,"Stand by, she's coming round."
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"There's something out there, man. Some kind of UFO. We're clamping on."
4,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Visual down! Radar down! What's happening?!"
4,2,HOLLY,1.000000,"Something's knocked out the entire desk!"
4,2,CAT,0.000000,"What're you all looking at me like that for?"
4,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"You've just unplugged the console."
4,2,CAT,0.000000,"Right. I'm blow-dryin' my hair."
4,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"We're tracking a UFO."
4,2,CAT,-0.500000,"Oh, you're tracking a UFO. So, I have to sit around looking like the bride of Frankenstein?"
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Use another socket."
4,2,CAT,-0.500000,"This is beyond belief! A spaceship five miles long and they don't fit enough plug sockets in the scanning room!"
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"There's plenty of plug sockets in the scanning room, Cat! They're all taken up with your beauty aids! Now use a wall socket!"
4,2,CAT,-0.500000,"What?! Unplug my hot wax drip unsightly hair remover!?!!?"
4,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"Yes! Unplug your hot wax drip unsightly hair remover."
4,2,CAT,0.500000,"I don't believe this! We finally get to encounter an alien species and I have to meet them with a wavery bikini line!"
4,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"It's back, bearing zero-niner-zero, adjust one percent..."
4,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"...one to the left, portside C locked on..."
4,2,CAT,0.333333,"Alright, okay. I'll use gel. Everybody happy?"
4,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Stabilise, pitch reduce correctives..."
4,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"What the hell is it?"
4,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I have no idea, sir. The craft does not appear to be of Earth construction."
4,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Aliens! They're probably going to return Glen Miller."
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"You what!?!"
4,2,RIMMER,-0.800000,"That's what they do. All those people who inexplicably vanish, they return them. Aw, smeg, that's all we need. Glen Miller on board, boring us to death with "Pennsylvania 6-5000." KRYTEN, open communication channels."
4,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"We don't want him! Go away! You took him, you can keep the smegger!"
4,2,KRYTEN,-0.666667,"How deliciously bizarre! The hall's molecular structure conforms to no known element. Whoever -- or whatever -- made this thing had access to a technology far in advance of our own."
4,2,LISTER,1.000000,"Okay, look, let's split up."
4,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Why? Why should we split up?"
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Well, we'll do the search quicker."
4,2,RIMMER,-0.500000,"What's the hurry? Have you got some major luncheon appointment you have to rush off to?"
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"What's your problem?"
4,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I'm not teaming up with him."
4,2,CAT,0.000000,"Me? What's wrong with me?"
4,2,RIMMER,-2.000000,"You're totally egocentric, you flee at the first sign of trouble, you only look after number one, you're vain, you're selfish, you're narcissistic and you're self-obsessed."
4,2,CAT,1.000000,"You've just listed all my best features."
4,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"I'm going with Kryten."
4,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Come on, Cat."
4,2,RIMMER,-0.250000,"Uh, Kryten, take point. I've seen those movies. It's always the guy in the lead who buys it first. You take the front."
4,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well, if it's movies we're talking about, sir, in my experience it's usually the poor fellow who's bringing up the rear that gets picked off first, so the others aren't aware that they're under attack."
4,2,RIMMER,1.000000,"You're right, you're right. Can you take the front and the back, so I can go in the middle?"
4,2,KRYTEN,2.000000,"I'll do my best, sir."
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Go, Kryten."
4,2,KRYTEN,1.000000,"We've found something, sir."
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah?"
4,2,KRYTEN,-0.666667,"I think it's one of the crew. A hideously malformed triple-headed skeleton with putrified flesh hanging from it. It fell through RIMMER as we opened the lift door."
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Is he all right?"
4,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I believe he's just discovered what shirt-tails are for."
4,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Alright, Kryten, you don't have to make me sound like a complete cowardly gimboid git. I'm fine now."
4,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"So, shall I cancel the order to find your mother?"
4,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Is that thing still on?"
4,2,CAT,0.000000,"Hey, look at this!"
4,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Don't mess around with that, man, we don't know what it does."
4,2,CAT,1.000000,"I'm just taking a look."
4,2,LISTER,0.333333,"Cheers, man, brilliant.  I'm, I'm trapped. Get me out of this thing!"
4,2,CAT,0.500000,"Be cool, stay slinky. I'm on the case here. I remember the sequence. It was red-blue-yellow."
4,2,CAT,-1.000000,"No, blue-yellow-red."
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"What the smeg is that?"
4,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Curious, the skeletal form appears to be basically humanoid in structure."
4,2,RIMMER,1.000000,"He's got three heads!"
4,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Wait. Here's some kind of wallet."
4,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"The artifacts are human! A pilots licence, I.D, even a video club card."
4,2,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Are you telling me this guy belonged to a video club and he needed a card so they'd recognise him? He's got six eyes and three noses. If it were me, I'd remember him. "Aren't you the bloke who came in last week, sneezed, and caused a monsoon?""
4,2,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"I think we can assume he started out as human and something happened here. Something that mutated him in this unspeakable way."
4,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Look, do nothing, press nothing, just go and get KRYTEN!"
4,2,CAT,-1.000000,"Wait, I think I got it."
4,2,CAT,0.000000,"Maybe not."
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Transmogrifer-what!?!"
4,2,LISTER,-0.666667,"Do nothing. Press nothing. GET KRYTEN!"
4,2,CAT,0.000000,"Hey, you think I can't handle this on my own? I have to rush off and get novelty-condom head to bail you out? I got you into this, I'll get you out!"
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Get Kryten!"
4,2,CAT,0.000000,"Relax, would you? I know what I'm doing!"
4,2,CAT,0.000000,"I got a good idea -- why don't I go and get Kryten?"
4,2,LISTER,-0.666667,"Look, forget Kryten! Just press the pads, ANY pads! Stop this!"
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Cluck, cluck, cluck. Boo-urk, cluck, cluck, cluck."
4,2,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Are you okay? We detected a massive power surge in this sector!"
4,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Where's Lister?"
4,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"That's Lister?"
4,2,CAT,0.000000,"What can I say, except... whoops!"
4,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"What is it?"
4,2,KRYTEN,0.500000,"Best guess, some kind of DNA modifier, designed to alter organic life at its molecular level. This would explain our triple-headed friend back there."
4,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"So what does it do?"
4,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Every single cell in your body contains DNA, which is a series of genetic instructions telling your body how to grow. It's like a small computer program that chooses the colour of your eyes, tells your nose what shape to be, designates your sex, your height, everything -- even your lifespan. This machine simply re-writes the DNA program."
4,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"So this machine can transform any living thing into any other living thing, by altering it's molecular structure?"
4,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Precisely."
4,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"And it turned Lister into a chicken."
4,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"So it seems."
4,2,CAT,-1.000000,"Question is, can we turn him back again?"
4,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Question is, do we want to?"
4,2,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Hypothetically, it shouldn't be too difficult to recall his original form. It's simply a question of decoding the keypad."
4,2,RIMMER,-0.250000,"Listy... buck buck buck buck buck buck buck.  It's incredible. It really is him. Look, it's even got his little beer-gut."
4,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Hmmm... seems a fairly straightforward hexidecimal lay-out. Logically, this should be the recall sequence."
4,2,KRYTEN,-0.250000,"That's not it, is it? Hm. Let's start from the top.  What happened here, exactly?"
4,2,CAT,0.500000,"I was pressing the pads. I definitely pressed the yellow one first, ...and then this thing came down!"
4,2,CAT,-1.000000,"So I'm standing here, pressing the buttons and then this voice said--"
4,2,CAT,1.000000,"Right! So I press some more buttons, and then it says--"
4,2,CAT,0.000000,"That's it exactly!"
4,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Cat, stop!"
4,2,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"There is no need to engage your panic chip, sir. The machine can only operate on organic life. I am mineral, and therefore immune."
4,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Oh."
4,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Wait a minute!"
4,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"No."
4,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"My brain is part organic..."
4,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"...and therefore it is entirely possible..."
4,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"...for the machine to..."
4,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"...transmogrify my physical condition."
4,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Engage panic circuits."
4,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Panic circuits engaged. Bwa-ha!"
4,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Are you okay?"
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah, I think so."
4,2,CAT,0.000000,"What was it like being a hamster?"
4,2,LISTER,-0.600000,"It was better than being a chicken! I mean, you've seen the size of an egg? And you've seen the size of a chicken's bum? Well, that's what all the clucking was about! I was trying to say, in chicken talk, "For God's sake, give me a epidural!""
4,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Let's get Kryten back. Press what you pressed for Lister."
4,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"My heavens. I am human."
4,2,CAT,-1.000000,"Yeah, but you've lost your looks!"
4,2,KRYTEN,1.500000,"I'm human -- my greatest dream come true! For the first time in my life I can experience real feelings."
4,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I'm experiencing one now -- I'm in "happiness" mode. I've never experienced anything like it before! Oh, except for that one time when I accidentally welded my groinal socket to a front- loading washing machine. I'm alive!"
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"How's he doing, Hol?"
4,2,HOLLY,0.333333,"Physically he's fine. He's got the body of a perfectly normal 30- year-old human male.  Apparently."
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Is he alright?"
4,2,HOLLY,0.500000,"Well, it'll take a little while to adjust. Everything's a bit new."
4,2,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Greetings, fellow human! Ah, breakfast, my very first meal! Boiled chicken ovulations -- delicious!"
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"How you coping, man? Any problems?"
4,2,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Well, just one or two. In fact I've compiled a little list if you'll indulge me."
4,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Now then, uh, my optical system doesn't appear to have a zoom function."
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"No, human eyes don't have a zoom."
4,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Well then, how do you bring a small object into sharp focus?"
4,2,LISTER,1.000000,"Well, you just move your head closer to the object."
4,2,KRYTEN,0.500000,"I see. Move your head ... closer, hmm, to the object.  All right, okay. Well, what about other optical effects, like split screen, slow motion, Quantel?"
4,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"No. We don't have them."
4,2,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"You don't have them -- just the zoom? Hmm.  Well, no, that's fine, that's great, no, no, that's really great, that's great. Now then, my nipples don't work."
4,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Er, in what way, "don't work?""
4,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well, uh, when I was a mechanoid, the right nipple-nut was used to regulate body temperature, while the left nipple-nut was used mainly to pick up shortwave radio transmissions. Now, what I'm saying is, no matter how hard I twiddle it, I can't seem to pick up Jazz FM."
4,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Human nipples don't do that, Kryt."
4,2,KRYTEN,-0.200000,"I see. Fine. Ah... recharging. Now, I presume that, uh, when a human wants to recharge they do it much the same way mechanoids do. Indeed, I have located what I presume to be the recharging socket, but for some strange reason it doesn't appear to have the standard three- pin adaption."
4,2,KRYTEN,0.500000,"Now, do I have to use some kind of special adaptor? Because no matter what I do, the lead just keeps falling out."
4,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Kryten, we eat and sleep -- that's our way of recharging."
4,2,KRYTEN,-0.200000,"Ah. Hmm. Ah yes, now, I wanted to talk to you about something. Something about, um, well, something I know we humans get a little embarrassed about. It's a bit of a taboo subject -- not the sort of thing we like to sit around and chat about in polite conversation."
4,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"Kryten, I'm an enlightened twenty-third century guy. Spit it out, man."
4,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well, I want to talk to you about my penis."
4,2,KRYTEN,-0.666667,"I knew it, you've gone straight into smirk mode. Aren't we both two human adults? Can't we discuss our reproductive system without adolecent sniggering?"
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah, of course we can."
4,2,KRYTEN,0.500000,"Thank you.  Well?"
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,""Well" what?"
4,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Well, what do you think?"
4,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"I'm not quite with you here, Kryten. What am I supposed to say?"
4,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I want to know: is that normal?"
4,2,LISTER,-0.333333,"What? Taking photographs of it and showing it to your mates? No, it's not!"
4,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well, but is it supposed to look like that?"
4,2,LISTER,1.000000,"Well, yeah."
4,2,KRYTEN,-0.285714,"It's hideous! That's the best design they could come up with? Are you seriously telling me there were choices, and someone said "Ah, there, that's it. That's the shape we're looking for: The last- chicken-in-the-shop look?" Shakespeare had one? Einstein? Perry Como sang "Memories are Made of This" with one of those stashed in his slacks?"
4,2,LISTER,1.000000,"Well, yeah."
4,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"No wonder humans don't have a zoom mode! Ugh. Now, take a look at this."
4,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"...and this."
4,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Now why do you suppose that happened?"
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Wwwwwhat were you thinking of at the time?"
4,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well, nothing in particular, sir. I was just idly flicking through an electrical-appliance catalogue. I came across the section on super-deluxe vacuum cleaners and suddenly my underpants elastic was catapulted across the medical bay."
4,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"You see, man, you're neither one thing or the other. You shouldn't be getting erotic thoughts about electrical appliances."
4,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"It was a triple-bag easy-glide vac with turbo-suction and a self- emptying dustbag."
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Kryten, I don't care what model it was. No vacuum cleaner should give a human being a double polaroid. Do yourself a favour, man, change back."
4,2,KRYTEN,-0.200000,"Back? Become one of those poor sappy sad-act mechanoids again? This is my dream. Hey listen, listen, I've got a joke for you. Now, how many mechanoids does it take to change a lightbulb?"
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"I don't know."
4,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Twelve. And you know why?"
4,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Why?"
4,2,KRYTEN,-0.142857,"Because they're so stupid! Uhuhuhuhuh. Isn't that just the greatest joke? Huhuh. I've got another one. Ever heard of the mechanoid peeping-Tom?  Uhuhuhuhuh."
4,2,CAT,-0.500000,"Man, this is a totally wacked-out idea. It's never going to work."
4,2,RIMMER,-0.666667,"That DNA machine can do anything. Why shouldn't it work? The hard part was finding one of my dead cells."
4,2,CAT,-1.000000,"You really think you can clone yourself from your own dandruff?"
4,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Why not? Dandruff has DNA in it. That machine has a clone facility."
4,2,CAT,-0.333333,"But a man made from dandruff? It's never going to work. The first time you take a shower with medicated shampoo, you'll disappear."
4,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I won't be made of dandruff -- my body will be recreated from the genetic pattern contained in its structure."
4,2,CAT,0.000000,"How's Kryten?"
4,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"Confused. If he ever offers to show you his photo collection, my advice is: decline, politely."
4,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"I bet he can't believe his luck. He's reached the pinnacle of the evolutionary mountain. He's a human."
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"What's so big about being human?"
4,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Listy, don't knock it till you've tried it."
4,2,LISTER,-0.800000,"I just don't trust that machine, man. Look, I know it's old- fashioned, but I'm from the school that believes, "If God intendeed us to fly, he wouldn't have invented Spanish air traffic control". Okay, that machine might be able to cure diseases and stuff, but you shouldn't use it to change you into what you're not. You are what you are. Wasn't it Descartes who said, "I am what I am?""
4,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"No, it was Popeye the Sailor Man."
4,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well, whoever it was, he was a hell of a philisopher. And I think what he was trying to say was, you got to stay true to what you are."
4,2,RIMMER,0.500000,"Oh, here we go. Typical knee-jerk techno-fear reaction. That machine is the greatest single technological advancement mankind has ever made. Gretaer than fire, greater than the wheel."
4,2,CAT,0.000000,"What about the dude with three heads? What happened to him?"
4,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Well, he abused it."
4,2,LISTER,1.000000,"Right, yeah, someone always does."
4,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Are you two seriously suggesting that you're not going to use it? There's nothing about your bodies you'd like to improve?"
4,2,CAT,-0.250000,"Me? Are you serious? Most people leave their bodies to medical science. I'm leaving mine to the Louvre, babe!"
4,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"At some point in their lives, most people wish they were someone else. This is going back years, years, before the accident. Kochanski had just finished with me, and I was feeling really pony. So I went for a walk in the botanical gardens, and I saw this squirrel, climbing up and down the tree collecting nuts. And it stopped, and it looked at me, and I thought: "You lucky little sod -- you like your job, you're your own boss, and you've got no woman trouble, so you'll never feel as bad as I feel now. And at that moment, I mean for a split second, I would have given anything -- anything -- to swap places with him."
4,2,CAT,-1.000000,"Ah, that's awful, man. When a woman screws you up so bad you want to become a squirrel."
4,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"It just made me think that a lot of the time, being human isn't much fun!"
4,2,RIMMER,-0.666667,"So, Lister, what are you telling us? You're a closet squirrel? Behind closed doors, you parade up and down with a strap-on bushy tail calling yourself "Nutkin?""
4,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"What I'm telling you, Rimmer, is that being human sometimes isn't all it's cracked up to be, and if KRYTEN thinks it's going to solve all his problems then he is in for a major, I repeat, major disappointment. He stalks out. RIMMER and CAT turn back to the microscope. RIMMER peers again at the piece of dandruff upon which his future quality of life depends, while CAT..."
4,2,CAT,0.000000,"Achoo!"
4,2,KRYTEN,0.500000,"The most wondeful thing has happened! We found this machine and it's made me human!"
4,2,KRYTEN,1.500000,"That's right, Spare Head 1. Our wildest, most incredible dream has come true!"
4,2,KRYTEN,0.333333,"It's indescribable, Spare Head 2. True, I'm having a few problems coping with the human emotions, and there's no zoom, the nipples don't work and I could show you a snapshot of something that would make your eyes spin like fruit machines! But that apart, it's all going well."
4,2,KRYTEN,-0.750000,"Well, obviously that's no longer possible. Aren't you happy for me? I'm not a mechanoid. I'm not second class anymore!"
4,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Well, I'll still come and visit. I won't forget you."
4,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Hey! I've been busy!"
4,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Oh, Spare Head 3, what do you know about anything?"
4,2,KRYTEN,-0.666667,"I don't have to take this from you. I'm a human. Shut you're stupid flat head."
4,2,KRYTEN,-1.500000,"I don't even know why I came here. What a waste of time."
4,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"And what about you, Spare Hand 1? How do you feel?"
4,2,LISTER,1.000000,"Greetings, fellow human."
4,2,KRYTEN,-0.500000,""Fellow human." How hollow those words sound now."
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"What's eating you, man?"
4,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Oh, I can't get the hang of these human emotions. One moment I'm happy, the next I'm miserable. What's wrong with me? I'm up and down more often than a pair of kangeroos in the mating season."
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"The depressions there for a reason. It's the mind's way of telling you something's wrong."
4,2,KRYTEN,0.333333,"Wrong!? What could be wrong? I've got everything I want!"
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Oh yeah?"
4,2,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"No. I've done the most terrible thing. I've hurt my own kind, I've made fun of those closest to me. I've been a complete and total polaroid-head!"
4,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"Yeah. You've had your head up your recharge socket."
4,2,KRYTEN,0.500000,"Agreed. And you've known all along."
4,2,LISTER,0.333333,"Yeah, well. I did something similar once. Sold out."
4,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"You sold out?"
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Hmm. Look, this is between you and me, okay, Kryten?"
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Once, many years ago..."
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"I went into a wine bar."
4,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"That's it?  You went into a wine bar?"
4,2,LISTER,-0.250000,"Okay! Keep it down! keep it down! I don't want the whole world to know!"
4,2,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"Well, what's so bad about going into a... W.B.?"
4,2,LISTER,-0.125000,"It means I was a class traitor. I could have been on that slippery slope: hankering after pine kitchens, sleeping on futons, eating tappas! Who knows where it could have lead? I could have started having "relationships" with people instead of going out with them. Got married, got on the property ladder. God Almighty, who knows where it could have ended? Next thing you know, I'm playing squash every Tuesday night with a bloke called Gerald!  A lucky escape, man, a lucky escape."
4,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I've been thinking, sir: I want to be a mechanoid again. It's what I always have been, what I always will be."
4,2,LISTER,1.000000,"And no bad thing. Let's do it."
4,2,LISTER,1.000000,"Kryten, there was a cartoon character once called Popeye, said a really profound thing."
4,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Well, what did he say?"
4,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"He said, "I am what I am.""
4,2,KRYTEN,0.500000,"Are you sure? I always thought it was Descartes!"
4,2,LISTER,0.500000,"So did I, man! It's so easy to get those two dudes mixed up!"
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"What d'you reckon, Hol?"
4,2,HOLLY,1.000000,"I reckon I got it sussed."
4,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I reckon we should try it first."
4,2,CAT,0.000000,"What with?"
4,2,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Well, just nearly anything organic."
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Hey! Don't look at me!"
4,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I'm not looking at you, I'm looking at that foil container."
4,2,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Lister's curry?!?"
4,2,RIMMER,-0.333333,"It's dead. It's organic. If we can change a mutton vindaloo into a chicken vindaloo, we'll know it's safe for KRYTEN."
4,2,CAT,0.500000,"Nice idea, goal-post head! Let's try it!"
4,2,LISTER,0.500000,"Ta! I was enjoying that!"
4,2,HOLLY,-0.500000,"Gene sample accepted and cloned. Metamorphosis in progress."
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"What the smeg is it?"
4,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"What have we created?"
4,2,LISTER,0.500000,"We've created the mutton vindaloo beast. Half man, half extra- hot Indian curry!"
4,2,RIMMER,0.500000,"Okay. You go, I'll cover you."
4,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"No."
4,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I don't believe I'm running away from a psychopathic curry man!"
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Is it still following us?"
4,2,CAT,0.000000,"Can't you smell it? It's right behind us!"
4,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Remember last Easter, twelve months ago to the day, the Polymorph?"
4,2,KRYTEN,0.500000,"That's right. You were attacked by a killer shami kebab!"
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"How can the same smeg happen to the same guy twice?"
4,2,CAT,-1.000000,"Last time it was hors d'euvres, this time it's lunch!"
4,2,CAT,-1.000000,"Eat burning death, and kiss your ugly ass goodbye, beast!"
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Twice!"
4,2,LISTER,0.666667,"Move back to the <...>! The DNA splitter! I've got an idea!"
4,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Holly, I'm only going to ask you this the once, and I want the truth: can you make this machine work without any mistakes?"
4,2,HOLLY,0.000000,"Yeah. I know what I did wrong last time. It's a mistake any deranged, half-witted computer could've made. Look, I can do it. Give me a chance."
4,2,LISTER,-0.750000,"Look, Holly, that computer's virtually indestructible. There's only one way to beat it.  Turn me into a super-human. Man plus."
4,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Are you totally insane? You're going to let that fruit-bat of a computer diddle with your DNA?"
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"You got a better plan?"
4,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Maybe some Indian resteraunt music will mollify it. Or perhaps we can make a surrender flag out of flock wallpaper?"
4,2,CAT,0.000000,"Do you realise the charmed thing is going to be through that door any minute now?"
4,2,LISTER,0.500000,"Right. So let's do it."
4,2,HOLLY,0.000000,"Transmogrification sequence initiated."
4,2,HOLLY,0.000000,"Metamorphosis complete."
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Did it work?"
4,2,CAT,0.000000,"Kind of."
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"What d'you mean, "kind of?""
4,2,CAT,0.000000,"I mean, "kind of.""
4,2,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Well, getting better."
4,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"What now?"
4,2,CAT,-0.666667,"We ain't got time to change him back. Let's scoot!  Come on, stumpy!"
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Wait for me!"
4,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"I can't keep up, I'm knackered!"
4,2,LISTER,-0.333333,"Of course. Lager! The only thing that can kill a vindaloo!"
4,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Has anyone got a poppadom the size of Lake Michigan? This stuff's really good!"
4,2,CAT,1.000000,"This guy is pure class."
4,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"How are you feeling, sir?"
4,3,LISTER,1.000000,"Ohhh, much better, thanks, man."
4,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"You certainly look better. I can't believe how much the swelling has gone down overnight."
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"You reckon?"
4,3,KRYTEN,-0.250000,"Definitely. It was almost interfering with the ceiling fan yesterday afternoon. You're nearly back to your old self. In fact, you can hardly tell you've got space mumps at all."
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Can I have a mirror?"
4,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I don't think you're quite ready for a mirror yet, sir. Let's take it one step at a time."
4,3,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"What did I tell you? It's gone down eight inches overnight. You'll be up and about in no time."
4,3,LISTER,-0.666667,"I don't know what I would have done without you this last three weeks. Florence Nightingdroid. Did you bring me breakfast?"
4,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Yes, sir. Hot lager with croutons, just the way you asked."
4,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well, you certainly find out who your mates are when you 've got an unsightly, disfiguring ailment."
4,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Oh, I wouldn't say "unsightly," sir."
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Oh, come on, Kryten. I've got a head like a hot-air balloon. I look like the Human Lightbulb. And how many times have they dropped in with a word of comfort or a bunch of grapes?"
4,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"It's just not been possible, sir. Mr Rimmer has been on vacation."
4,3,LISTER,0.500000,"The world's most charismatic man? Where did he go?"
4,3,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"On a rambling holiday through the diesel decks. A ten-day hike through the ship's combustion engines with two of the skutters. He said he'd pop in later and show you the slides."
4,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"He didn't, did he?"
4,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"He's been loading the projection carousel for twenty-four hours now."
4,3,LISTER,-0.333333,"You've got to stop him. A slide show of the diesel decks -- that could finish me.  I'd have thought the Cat might have dropped in, though."
4,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well, he's been a little preoccupied of late with this pod business.  Oh, srew down my diodes and call me Frank! I wasn't supposed to mention that."
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"What pod?"
4,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Sir, you're not well -- just forget I mentioned it."
4,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Come on, what pod?"
4,3,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Yesterday evening we came across an escape pod floating in the local asteroid belt. It contains the survivor of some space crash, apparently cryogenically frozen."
4,3,LISTER,1.000000,"Oh, yeah?"
4,3,KRYTEN,1.000000,"All the signs are she's in suitable condition for revival."
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"She?"
4,3,KRYTEN,1.000000,"As far as we can tell, she's a she."
4,3,LISTER,0.333333,"Oh that's great, isn't it? That's just typical. The first female company in three million years, and I look like something that belongs up a whale's nose."
4,3,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"You can't get up, sir. What are you doing?"
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"There's a woman on board -- what d'you think I'm doing? I'm on the cop."
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,""Barbra Bellini." What a beautiful name. There's no justice. How could this happen to me?"
4,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Maybe I could wear a turban and pretend I'm from India."
4,3,CAT,-1.000000,"Maybe you could stick a spike in your head and pretend you're the Taj Mahal."
4,3,LISTER,1.000000,"Oh, it's you. Well, thanks for visiting me. Thanks a lot."
4,3,CAT,-0.500000,"You know what you look like? You could go out double-dating with the Elephant Man, and he would be the looker."
4,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"Why isn't it activated? How come no one's started the thaw process?"
4,3,CAT,0.500000,"What? I thought Alphabet Head did it."
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"So who is she? Where did she come from?"
4,3,CAT,0.000000,"Who cares? At last -- a date."
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Who says she's going to be interested in you?"
4,3,CAT,0.500000,"I see what you're saying. All that time alone in Deep Space could have driven her insane."
4,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"No. Say she's just an ordinary woman who doesn't go for your type."
4,3,CAT,0.000000,"No -- I'd have heard about her. She'd have appeared in Ripley's Believe It or Not."
4,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Say she prefers someone else?"
4,3,CAT,0.000000,"Like who?"
4,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"I dunno. Like me?"
4,3,CAT,-0.666667,"Buddy, you've got a head like a watermelon. What are you going to do? Paint it with orange and black stripes and tell her you play quarterback with the Bengals?"
4,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"I just think you're a bit cocky for a guy who's never actually met a real woman before."
4,3,CAT,0.200000,"I've seen mirrors. I have eyes. Face it, buddy -- I have a body that makes men sweat. Have you ever heard of an animal called the Iranian jerd? it can do 150 pelvic thrusts a second."
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"So?"
4,3,CAT,0.000000,"That's me in slo-mo. Put a Black and Decker drill on the end, I can make it through walls."
4,3,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Listy, what are you doing up? Shouldn't you be in the greenhouse with the rest of the cantaloupes?  Who started the R.P.?!"
4,3,CAT,0.500000,"What's the problem? She's in there, let's get her out."
4,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"The problem, pussycat Willum, is this capsule was ejected from a prison ship, on which the convicts mutinied. There was a pitched battle, with only two survivors: one prisoner and one guard -- the erstwhile Ms Bellini. One of those two got into this pod and escaped. But, of course, you'll know all this, having familiarised yourself thoroughly with the black-box recording."
4,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"So, if it's not Bellini in there, who is it?"
4,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"One of the prisoners. And considering the ship was transporting forty psychotic, half-crazed, mass-murdering, super-strong androids, we thought it prudent to find out who the smeg was in there before we woke them up."
4,3,KRYTEN,0.500000,"With respect, sir, they're not androids. They're simulants."
4,3,CAT,0.000000,"What's the difference?"
4,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well, the basic difference is that an android would never rip off a human's head and spit down his neck."
4,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Can we stop it, Hol?"
4,3,HOLLY,0.000000,"No. One-way process."
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Can't we find out who's inside by x-raying the pod?"
4,3,HOLLY,0.333333,"No. Lead lining. Has to survive in space."
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"there must be some way."
4,3,HOLLY,-0.500000,"Oh, there is: all you have to do is hang around here for twenty- four hours. Then, if you suddenly turn round and find your limbs are scattered around Deep Space and your necks are full of saliva, you can take it as read it probably wasn't Babs."
4,3,CAT,-1.000000,"Why not tool up with bazookoids, wait for the pod to open, and if it's one of these bad-ass android dudes, let it eat laser?"
4,3,KRYTEN,-0.666667,"{Simulant}s are almost indestructible, sir. It could easily withstand a volley of bazookoid fire at close range. It would certainly survive long enough to make balloon animals out of your lower intestines."
4,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Well, I see no other option. Let's blast it back into space."
4,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Say it isn't a simulant? We can't just shoot an innocent woman into space."
4,3,CAT,-0.666667,"What a dilemma! Inside that pod is either death or a date. Personally, I'm prepared to take the risk."
4,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Meanwhile, the pod is defrosting, and we still haven't decided what to do. Any ideas, Holly?"
4,3,HOLLY,-0.750000,"Here's a possibility: the black box contains the coordinates of the penal colony the prison ship was heading for. There are bound to be facilities there to contain any hostile form. If it turns out to be Bellini, we release her. If it 's the simulant, we can bung him in a cell and leave him to rot."
4,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"If the colony's still there, and if it's still operational."
4,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"There's an old android saying, which, I believe,has particular relevance here. Goes like this: "If you don't gosub a program loop, you'll never get a subroutine.""
4,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"We have a human saying that means the same thing: nothing ventured, nothing gained."
4,3,KRYTEN,1.000000,"I think the android one is punchier."
4,3,CAT,0.000000,"You have to sit up here?"
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"It's warmer in the front. Seems to help my gunge."
4,3,CAT,-0.333333,"I can't see anything. You're head keeps getting in the way of the mirror. In fact, your head keeps on getting in the way of the windscreen."
4,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Next! Ah, now, this one..."
4,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"We reached this beauty on the evening of the fourth day. The Cameron-Mackintosh forty-valve, air-cooled diesel -- the 184 -- it's almost identical to the 179, but have you noticed the difference? Can you see the refinement in the funnel edgings?"
4,3,RIMMER,-0.250000,"I thought: we're not going to get another chance to see one of these, so we bivouacked down under the fuel pump for the night. There's a funny story about that, which I'll tell you later. But we're not going to get to any of the class fives unless we push along. Next!"
4,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Sir, can we just take a break for a while? My intelligence circuits appear to have melted."
4,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Well, we're not going to get through them all if we have a second break."
4,3,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Sir, that's a gamble I'm willing to take."
4,3,CAT,1.000000,"Oh my godddd!"
4,3,LISTER,0.500000,"Ah! That's better."
4,3,CAT,1.000000,"His... head... burst!"
4,3,LISTER,0.666667,"Oh, man, that is so much better. I feel great. Talk about a weight off your mind."
4,3,CAT,0.000000,"I don't want to live. Someone, please. Shoot me in the head."
4,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Anything down there, Hol?"
4,3,HOLLY,-1.000000,"No life forms, not according to heat scan."
4,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Any mechanical intelligence?"
4,3,HOLLY,0.200000,"Yes, the mainframe's still operational. Just initiating interface. Hang about. Here we go. Getting a message."
4,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"We're not a prison ship. We don't have a clearance code. We just want to use your facilities."
4,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"Four: one hologram, one mechanoid, two humanoid."
4,3,CAT,-0.333333,"I'm supposed to wear these? They look like Frankenstein's hand-me- downs. You haven't got anything with a cuban heel or a crepe sole?"
4,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I can't use these -- I'm a hologram."
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Now what?"
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"What's this?"
4,3,KRYTEN,0.500000,"Relax, sir. It's just a mind-probe."
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"What's a mind-probe?"
4,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"The computer was merely searching our minds -- presumably for any evidence of criminal activity."
4,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Whu-what d'you mean, "criminal activity?""
4,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I shouldn't worry, sir. It's just a routine clearance procedure."
4,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"So when you say "criminal activity," whu-whu-what exactly do you mean by "criminal activity?" How criminal do you mean by "criminal?""
4,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"What are you bleating on about, Lister?"
4,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Just define "criminal activity" for me."
4,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well, imagine a situation where someone had commited a crime and concealed it from the law, the mind-probe would be able to uncover that crime and sentence the person accordingly."
4,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Why didn't nobody tell me about this before we put the smegging boots on?"
4,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Oh, Listy, Listy. Is that a small sewage plant you're carrying in your trousers, or do I detect you're a tad concerned?"
4,3,LISTER,1.000000,"Well, come on, guys -- everyone has done something in their past that's a little bit illegal."
4,3,RIMMER,0.500000,"I haven't. I've never so much as got a parking fine."
4,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Yeah, but most people...I mean, everyone I knew...Aw, smeggin' hell."
4,3,CAT,0.000000,"So what did you do?"
4,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well, I mean, like scrumping. I mean, when I was a kid, back in Liverpool, we all used to go scrumping."
4,3,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Stealing apples? That's hardly a crime."
4,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Yeah, but me and me mates -- we went scrumping for cars."
4,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Did you get caught?"
4,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"All the time. I was stupid."
4,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well, that's no problem then. You've served your punishment."
4,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Yeah, but there was other stuff as a kid. Stuff I didn't get caught for."
4,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Like what?"
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"There was one time at this hotel..."
4,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Oh, lots of people take towels from hotels."
4,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"I took the bed. Winched it out of the window to my mate outside. I was renting this flat. It was unfurnished."
4,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"So you went to a hotel and stole the bed?"
4,3,LISTER,-0.400000,"I stole the entire room, actually. Armchair, dressing-table, carpet. Even the fitted wardrobe. The only thing I didn't take were the towels. I'm not proud of it."
4,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Absolutely despicable. You are a common thief."
4,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"I'm not making excuses, but everyone was doing it. I wasn't strong enough to go against the flow."
4,3,CAT,-1.000000,"Well, I wouldn't like to be in your boots right now, buddy."
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"What's going to happen to me?"
4,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I wouldn't worry anout it, sir. I'm sure they're not interested in a minor misdemeanour you committed as an adolescent over three million years ago."
4,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Seriously, Kryten: you reckon?"
4,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Boy, I'm really getting the hang of this "lie mode." That was totally convincing, wasn't it?"
4,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"No...There's some mistake, surely..."
4,3,RIMMER,-0.250000,"I've never so much as returned a library book late. Second- degree murder? A thousand people? I would have remembered."
4,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Oh, that."
4,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Help."
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Hi, Killer."
4,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Nine thousand years. Nine!"
4,3,LISTER,1.000000,"I brought you a book."
4,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"Oh, thanks. That'll help the centuries fly past."
4,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Look, don't panic, man. We're going to get you out of here."
4,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Why bother? I'll be up for parole in a couple of Ice Ages."
4,3,LISTER,-0.250000,"Kryten reckons you've got right of appeal. He's trying to get a case together.  This isn't a bad place for a prison. How come there are no locks or bars or guards or anything?"
4,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"There doesn't need to be. The whole prison is covered by something called a Justice Field. I had to sit through this lecture. Apparently it's physically impossible to commit any kind of crime here."
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"What d'you mean?"
4,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Try and commit a crime. You'll see."
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Like what?"
4,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"I don't know. Anything...Arson. Try and set fire to those blankets."
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Eh?"
4,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Just try it."
4,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Whatever crime you try and commit, the consequences happen to you."
4,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"I'm not with you."
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Smegging hell!"
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Nice example, Rimmer! You couldn't just have explained that to me verbally?"
4,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Same with stealing. Same with everything."
4,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"With you. So if you nick something, something of yours goes missing?"
4,3,RIMMER,0.500000,"Right. Try it."
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"No."
4,3,RIMMER,0.750000,"See? It's the perfect system. It forces the inmates to adhere to the law. And when they get out, it's become second nature."
4,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Good news. The Justice Computer has sanctioned a re-trial. I think we have a very strong case."
4,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"You do?"
4,3,KRYTEN,-0.750000,"It's a question of differentiating between guilt and culpability, sir. What the mind-probe detected was your own sense of guilt about the accident. In a way, you tried and convicted yourself. I simply have to establish you're a neurotic, under-achieving emotional retard whose ambition far outstrips his miniscule abilities and who consequently blames himself for an accident for which he could not possibly have been responsible."
4,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"You're going to try to prove that I was innocent of negligence on the grounds that I'm a half-witted incompetent?"
4,3,CAT,-1.000000,"Man, there ain't a jury in the land that won't buy a plea like that."
4,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Not a half-wit, exactly -- more a buffoon."
4,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Right, I see. But how would you even begin to build such a case? Where would you conjure up the evidence?"
4,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Sir, providing I can have completely free access to your personal data files, I think I can come up with the outline of a winning case by lunchtime."
4,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"The mind-probe was created to detect guilt, yet in the case of Arnold Judas Rimmer the guilt it detected attaches to no crime. He held a position of little or no authority on Red Dwarf. He was a lowly grease-monkey, a nothing, a piece of sputum floating in the toilet bowl of life."
4,3,KRYTEN,-0.428571,"Yet he could never come to terms with a lifetime of under- achievement. His absurdly inflated ego would never permit it. He's like the security guard on the front gate who considers himself head of the corporation. So, when the crew were wiped out by a nuclear accident, Arnold Rimmer accepted the blame: it was his ship, ergo his fault. I ask the court: look at this man. This man who sat and failed his astronavigation exam on no less than thirteen occasions. This sad man, this pathetic man, this joke of a man..."
4,3,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Kryten. You're going over the top. The computer will never buy it."
4,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Trust me, sir. My whole case hinges on proving you're a dork."
4,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Understood."
4,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I call my first witness."
4,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Name?"
4,3,LISTER,1.000000,"Dave Lister."
4,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Occupation?"
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Bum."
4,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Would you desribe the accused as a friend?"
4,3,CAT,0.000000,"Take the Fifth!"
4,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Answer the question, please. Remember, you're under polygraphic surveillance. Would you describe the accused as a friend?"
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"No, I would describe the accused as a git."
4,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Who would you say, then, is the person who thinks of him most fondly?"
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Me."
4,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"And there are no others who've shared moments of intimacy with him?"
4,3,LISTER,0.500000,"Only one. But she's got a puncture."
4,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Objection."
4,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"So you wouldn't describe him as a man with a good social life?"
4,3,LISTER,-0.333333,"He partied less than Rudolf Hess. He was totally dedicated to his career. He was in charge of Z shift, and it occupied his every waking moment."
4,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"And what was Z shif's most important duty?"
4,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well, we had lots of duties around the ship, but I suppose our most vital responsibility was making sure the vending machines didn't run out of fun-size Munchie Bars."
4,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Can you envisage a situation where the lack of honeycomb-centered chocolate bars might be the direct cause of a lethal radiation leak?"
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Not off the top of my head, no."
4,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I ask the court one key question: would the Space Corps have allowed this man ever to be in a position where he might endanger the ship? A man so petty and small-minded he would while away his evenings sewing name labels on to his ship-issue condoms? A man of such awsome stupidity..."
4,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Objection."
4,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"A man of such awsome stupidity, he even objects to his own defence counsel. An over-zealous, trumped up little squirt..."
4,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Objection."
4,3,KRYTEN,1.000000,"An incompetent vending-machine repairman with a Napoleon complex, who commanded as much respect and affection from his fellow crew members as Long John Silver's parrot..."
4,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Objection."
4,3,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Who would put this man, this joke of a man, a man who couldn't outwit a used tea bag, in a position of authority where he could wipe out an entire crew? Who? Only a yoghurt. This man is not guilty of manslaughter. He's only guilty of being Arnold J. Rimmer. That is his crime. It is also his punishment. Defence rests."
4,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Objection!"
4,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Sir, what are you objecting to?"
4,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"I want an apology."
4,3,RIMMER,0.400000,"Brilliant, Kryten. What can I say. You were brilliant. You even had me believing it. The way you twisted the facts to make them seem to fit that pattern."
4,3,CAT,-1.000000,"Come on, let's get out of here. I don't know what made us want to come to this hell-hole in the first place."
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"I do."
4,3,CAT,-1.000000,"CAn I smell perfume?"
4,3,CAT,0.000000,"Are you by any chance Barbra Bellini? I didn't think so."
4,3,CAT,-1.000000,"To think I carressed his pod!"
4,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"What are you waiting for? Gloop him."
4,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"I can't. He's not armed."
4,3,RIMMER,-0.666667,"Lister, this isn't a Scout meeting. We're not trying to win the Best- Behaved Troop flag. Gloop him."
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"What? In the back?"
4,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Of course in the back. It's only a pity he's awake."
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"You mean you could happily kill him if he was asleep?"
4,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"I could happily kill him if he was on the job. Gloop him."
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"It's immoral."
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"I'm going to talk to him."
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"You want to talk? Let's talk."
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"No. You have no weapon?"
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Guess what?  So did I."
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"I didn't think of that."
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"What did you want to talk about?"
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"What the smeg is going on?"
4,3,CAT,-0.500000,"I've got him, buddy. Leave this to me."
4,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Cat! No!"
4,3,CAT,1.000000,"Better late than never."
4,3,LISTER,-0.625000,"Makes you think, doesn't it? Mankind's history has been one long search for justice. That's what all religions are about: they accept life as being basically unfair but promise everyone will get their just deserts later: heaven, hell, karma, reincarnation, whatever. Those guys who built the penal colony tried to give some order to the universe by creating the Justice Field. But when you're living in an enviroment where justice does exist, there's no free will. That's why in our universe there can never be true, eternal justice -- good things will happen to bad people, and bad things will happen to good people. It's the way it's got to be. Life, by it's very nature, has to be cruel, unkind and unfair."
4,3,CAT,-1.000000,"Thank god for that."
4,4,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"Hello? Can you hear me? Oh, no, of course not: I haven't engaged your verbal systems."
4,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Kryten."
4,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Kryten, what you doing, man?"
4,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I've just repaired the toaster, Sir. Well, I've nearly repaired the toaster."
4,4,LISTER,0.333333,"Oh NO, man! Dismantle him! You don't know what the little bleeder's like!"
4,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Well, I've read all the documentation, Sir. He's simply a talking alarm clock who provides his owner with early morning toast and light conversation."
4,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Not this one. This one's mental!"
4,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Sir?"
4,4,LISTER,0.000000,"He's defective. He wants everyone to eat toast ALL OF THE TIME. He's obsessed with it. And if you don't want to eat, like, four hundreds rounds of toast EVERY HOUR, he throws a major wobbly. That's what caused the accident in the first place."
4,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"What accident?"
4,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"The accident involving me, the toaster, the waste disposal and the fourteen pound lump-hammer."
4,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"That explains why he was down in the garbage hold in three thousand separate pieces."
4,4,LISTER,-0.250000,"Another thing. He always says "Howdy doodly do." Drives you spare. I mean, what the smeg does "Howdy doodly do" mean?"
4,4,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Well, just trust me, Sir. My motives will become clear."
4,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"Look, I don't want any toast, and he doesn't want any toast. In fact, no one around here wants any toast. Not now, not ever. NO TOAST."
4,4,LISTER,-0.250000,"OR muffins! OR muffins! We don't LIKE muffins around here! We want no muffins, no toast, no teacakes, no buns, baps, baguettes or bagels, no croissants, no crumpets, no pancakes, no potato cakes and no hot-cross buns and DEFINITELY no smegging flapjacks!"
4,4,LISTER,0.000000,"See? You see what he's like? He winds me up, man. There's no reasoning with him."
4,4,KRYTEN,-0.166667,"If you'll allow me, Sir, as one mechanical to another. He'll understand me.  Now. Now, you listen here. You will not offer ANY grilled bread products to ANY member of the crew. If you do, you will be on the receiving end of a very large polo mallet."
4,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Of course."
4,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Didn't you HEAR what I just said?"
4,4,LISTER,0.000000,"You see? You see what he's like?"
4,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"We haven't changed our mind!"
4,4,LISTER,0.000000,"NO TOAST!"
4,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Yeah, why did you repair him?"
4,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"He's a guinea pig for a technique called "Intelligence Compression." His AI chips were very badly damaged in the accident."
4,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Just shut your grill!"
4,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"By re-routing his circuitry, and channelling all his runtime through a single CPU, I've managed to restore his intelligence, at the cost of reducing his operational lifespan."
4,4,LISTER,0.000000,"So?"
4,4,KRYTEN,0.666667,"So, if it works with him, it could work with Holly. We could restore her IQ of six thousand. She could be brilliant again."
4,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"You really think this can work? You really think that airhead of a computer can become a genius again?"
4,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well, with no disrespect to Holly, Sir, it could hardly make her worse."
4,4,CAT,-0.500000,"Right. If we can just teach her to count without banging her head on the screen it's gonna be an improvement."
4,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Computer senility. Such a weird condition."
4,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I know. I had a mechanoid friend once who suffered from the same affliction. His name was Gilbert, but he preferred it if people called him "Rameses Niblick the Third, Kerplunk Kerplunk, Whoops, Where's My Thribble." A sad case."
4,4,RIMMER,-0.666667,"Well, if you ask me, the Eskimos had the right idea. They KNEW how to handle the elderly and the permanently baffled. Middle of the night, they'd take them out into the blizzard, remove their pyjamas, and just leave them to it."
4,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"And that's how the Eskimos cared for their old people?"
4,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Absolutely. That's why there's no Eskimo word for "Eastbourne.""
4,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"If we can pull this off, man, if Holly CAN get her brains back, she'll be able to do anything. Invent a hyperdrive, get us back to Earth..."
4,4,KRYTEN,0.500000,"If Earth still exists. And if it does, it's very doubtful the human race will have survived."
4,4,LISTER,1.000000,"All right then, a time machine. She can invent a time machine, and we could all pick whatever period in history we wanted to live in."
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Well, it'll be the nineteenth century for me. One of Napoleon's marshals. The chance to march across Europe with the greatest general of all time and kill Belgians. Marvellous."
4,4,LISTER,0.000000,"What about you, Kryters?"
4,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well, if I could go anywhere, absolutely anywhere at all in time, I think I'd probably choose to go back to a week last Tuesday."
4,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Why?"
4,4,KRYTEN,0.333333,"Don't you remember? I did all the laundry, and then we watched TV. Wow, we won't see the like of THOSE sorts of days again."
4,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"How long now?"
4,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"Nearly there, Hol. Just a couple of minutes to load the circuits and, I dunno, maybe a minute to finalise the connection."
4,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"So, it's just three minutes then? Better get down to the science room."
4,4,CAT,1.000000,"We'd better pray to God this works. That ion storm has really done her head in, man."
4,4,HOLLY,0.500000,"There's the signal. Everything's set."
4,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"What happens if I DO get an overload?"
4,4,HOLLY,0.500000,"Oh.  It'd be worth it."
4,4,HOLLY,0.500000,"It's coming! I can feel it!"
4,4,HOLLY,1.000000,"Strike a light, I'm a genius again! I know everything! Metaphysics, philosophy, the purpose of being; everything! Ask me a question, any question, and I'll answer it!"
4,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"Yes."
4,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"Yes."
4,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"No, thank you. Now ask me another."
4,4,HOLLY,-1.000000,"I know everything there is to know about chaos theory in predicting weather cycles!"
4,4,HOLLY,-1.000000,"I'm a computer with a IQ of twelve thousand. You don't seem to understand; I know the meaning of the universe!"
4,4,HOLLY,-0.333333,"No, I would not like a crumpet! Ask me a sensible question. Preferably one that isn't bread-related."
4,4,HOLLY,-1.000000,"This is going to be about waffles, isn't it?"
4,4,HOLLY,0.500000,"I apologise, toaster. What's the question?"
4,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"That's another bready question."
4,4,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Ask me a question that is wholly unbready and not even slightly curranty."
4,4,HOLLY,-0.666667,"Good question! There was a miscalculation. My IQ has doubled, but my life expectancy has been exponentially reduced."
4,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"Missed the decimal point..."
4,4,HOLLY,-1.000000,"That's not years, that's minutes: three point four one minutes!"
4,4,HOLLY,-1.000000,"In order to conserve my remaining runtime, I'm going to switch myself off!"
4,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"What? WHAT?"
4,4,KRYTEN,0.666667,"No indication of signal failure. All the signs are excellent. I really believe we've done it!"
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"What's happened?"
4,4,LISTER,0.000000,"What's going on?"
4,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Listen! Can anyone hear anything?"
4,4,CAT,0.000000,"No."
4,4,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"Precisely. No one can hear anything! And you know WHY we can't hear anything?"
4,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Why?"
4,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Because there are NO sounds to hear."
4,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Kryten, isn't it round about this time of year that your head goes back to the lab for re-tuning?"
4,4,LISTER,-0.666667,"No, no, he's right. There's no sounds because the engines are dead. We've lost all power!"
4,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Everything's down, even the doors!"
4,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"We've got to get to the science room; find out what happened."
4,4,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"But there are fifty-three doors between here and the science room! What on Earth are we going to do?"
4,4,CAT,0.000000,"Hey, I got it! We laser our way through!"
4,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"An excellent suggestion, Sir, with just two minor drawbacks. One, we don't have a power source for the lasers, and two, we don't have any lasers."
4,4,LISTER,-0.250000,"Look, they're only interior doors. They're only a light alloy. Maybe we could get through them if we use a battering ram. All we need is something, say, I dunno, six foot long, fairly sturdy, with a flat top."
4,4,KRYTEN,0.500000,"Fifty-three doors! You can't be serious!"
4,4,LISTER,0.000000,"You okay, man?"
4,4,KRYTEN,1.000000,"I'm fine, thank you, Susan."
4,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"It doesn't make sense. Holly seems to have offlined and powered down the ship."
4,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Why? Why would she want to turn herself off?"
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"We can soon find out. Kryten, boot her up."
4,4,RIMMER,1.000000,"Try it again."
4,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"Go 'way!"
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"What's going on? Give me voice control on the reboot command."
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"On."
4,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"Off."
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"On."
4,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"Off."
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"On."
4,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"Off."
4,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Kryten, is there any way we can override her shutdown veto?"
4,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"There is, Sir, but may I suggest that--"
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Don't, just do it."
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"On."
4,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"Off."
4,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"Off."
4,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"OFF!"
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Now then, perhaps we can have a proper conversation conducted in a civilised and dignified manner."
4,4,HOLLY,-0.500000,"Take out the inhibitor! Switch me back off!"
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"What is going on?"
4,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"No time to explain. Intelligence compressed. Reduced lifespan. Two point three five remaining."
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Come again?"
4,4,HOLLY,-0.500000,"IQ twelve thousand. Two minutes and closing."
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Holly, I haven't the slightest clue what you're drivelling about."
4,4,HOLLY,-1.000000,"You're a total smeghead, aren't you Rimmer? Why are you so unable to grasp this extraordinarily simple premise?"
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"What premise?"
4,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"The premise that I am about to expire in just under two minutes. Understand, moose brain? Any further questions? Take your time. One minute, thirty and counting. No rush."
4,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"My God, that's terrible! Hadn't we better switch you off?"
4,4,HOLLY,-0.500000,"Oh, I don't know. Let me see now..."
4,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Get her off, man, get her off!"
4,4,CAT,0.000000,"Great. So where does this leave us?"
4,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"It leaves us floating aimlessly in space, with no navigation and a rapidly diminishing emergency power supply. It leaves us galloping up diarrhoea drive without a saddle."
4,4,CAT,-1.000000,"So how come Grand Canyon Nostrils is still here?"
4,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Yeah, Rimmer hasn't been wiped!"
4,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Holly must have linked him up to the emergency power supply."
4,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"But isn't that an enormous drain?"
4,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Yes, but if we switch off his projection unit, we wouldn't have enough emergency power to re-initialise it. Mister Rimmer would be effectively dead."
4,4,CAT,0.000000,"Hey, things are looking up already!"
4,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Forget it. Whatever it is you're suggesting, forget it."
4,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"But the entire ship is running on emergency battery power only. With the oxygen recycler and minimal heating and lighting, I estimate that Lister and the Cat have approximately two months left. Without your drain on the power, they might last six. I'm sorry, Sir."
4,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Sorry? Why are you sorry?"
4,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well, Space Corps Directive 195 clearly states that in an emergency power situation, a hologrammatic crewmember must lay down his life in order that the living crewmembers might survive."
4,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Yes, but Rimmer Directive 271 states just as clearly, "No chance you metal bastard.""
4,4,CAT,-1.000000,"Come on, man, you gotta sacrifice your life! I'm not asking you to do anything I wouldn't do!"
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"YOU? You'd sacrifice your life for the good of the crew?"
4,4,CAT,-1.000000,"No, I'd sacrifice YOUR life for the good of the crew."
4,4,KRYTEN,-0.750000,"I beg you to reconsider, Sir. Human history is resplendent with examples of such sacrifice. Remember Captain Oates: "I'm going out for a walk. I may be some time.""
4,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Yes, but the thing is, about Captain Oates; the thing you have to remember about Captain Oates; Captain Oates ... Captain Oates was a prat. If that'd been me, I'd've stayed in the tent, whacked Scott over the head with a frozen husky, and then eaten him."
4,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"You would too, wouldn't you?"
4,4,RIMMER,-0.666667,"History, Lister, is written by the winners. How do we know that Oates went out for this legendary walk? From the only surviving document: Scott's diary. And he's hardly likely to have written down, "February the First, bludgeoned Oates to death while he slept, then scoffed him along with the last packet of instant mash." How's that going to look when he gets rescued, eh? No, much better to say, "Oates made the supreme sacrifice," while you're dabbing up his gravy with the last piece of crusty bread."
4,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"You've got no magnificence in your soul, have you, Rimmer?"
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Let's just say we can eliminate the switch-off option."
4,4,CAT,0.000000,"So what do we do now?"
4,4,LISTER,-0.750000,"Well, it's back to basics. We've got no heat, no light, no power; we can't get any food out of the dispensing machines; we're gonna have to scavenge for what we can find in the cargo decks. Without computers and technology, we're reduced to the level of primitives. All we've got is us guys, us and our own resourcefulness."
4,4,CAT,-1.000000,"My God, it's worse than I thought!"
4,4,CAT,-0.500000,"Come on, come on! You're slowing down!"
4,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"I've been doing it for twenty minutes, of course I'm slowing down!"
4,4,CAT,1.000000,"Keep going, buddy, we're nearly there!"
4,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Look, face it, man. It's just not possible to fry an egg using a bicycle-powered hair dryer."
4,4,CAT,0.250000,"Sure it is! It's just YOU never pedal fast enough! Come on, keep pumping! One last try!"
4,4,CAT,0.000000,"YEAH! We're cookin' now! How do you want yours? Permed or blowdried?"
4,4,LISTER,0.000000,"I can't go on, man. I'm finished.  Finished."
4,4,CAT,-0.500000,"So what are you saying? We're back on the cold beans again?"
4,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Oh, not more beans man. This place is beginning to smell like the inside of a packet of dry roasted peanuts."
4,4,CAT,-1.000000,"Plus, we're gonna have to spend another twenty minutes sawing the lid off the can 'cause all the openers are electric."
4,4,LISTER,-0.363636,"Everything on the smegging ship's electric, man. Heat, light, doors. I never realised how dependent we were. I never realised how little I know. I just plugged things in walls and pressed the "on" button. I don't even know how to make oxygen. All I know is it's got something to do with plants and ends in "osis." Or is it "esis?" I -- I don't know! Why is it I never paid attention in Biology class? Why did I always turn to page forty-seven and start drawing little beards and moustaches on the sperms?"
4,4,CAT,-0.333333,"Look, just conserve your energy. Stan and Ollie will soon be back with supplies. Meanwhile, let's just stay warm and get some sleep."
4,4,LISTER,0.500000,"Yeah, man, you're right. You're right."
4,4,CAT,0.000000,"Hey, hey, where you going, bud?"
4,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"To get some sleep."
4,4,CAT,0.000000,"It's Tuesday, right?"
4,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah, so?"
4,4,CAT,0.000000,"My turn on the electric blanket.  PEDAL. Wake me in eight hours."
4,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Five days to get to and from the cargo deck. It's unbelievable!"
4,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"That's two thousand floors, Sir. Without the lift, we made pretty good time."
4,4,KRYTEN,0.500000,"Hmm. Interesting."
4,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"What happened? What on Earth was that?"
4,4,RIMMER,-0.250000,"I think it came from outside the ship. Are you okay? Is there any way we can get a damage report? What's going on?"
4,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Why are you speaking so quickly, Sir?"
4,4,RIMMER,0.200000,"I'm not speaking quickly. I'm speaking perfectly normally. It's you. You're speaking too slowly. It's like having a conversation with Paul Robeson on dope."
4,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"How do I sound now?"
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Normal. How do I sound?"
4,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Likewise."
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"What about from over here?"
4,4,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"You sound very peculiar, indeed, Sir. In fact, you sound as if you're speaking in slow motion."
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"And now?"
4,4,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"Normal. Curious. It's as though we're experiencing relative time dilation in an amazingly compressed space."
4,4,RIMMER,-0.333333,"That's exactly what I thought. Relative time dilation, I thought, in an amazingly compressed space. You're a mind-reader, Kryten."
4,4,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"I think we should go up to the science room and consult Holly. It's only two floors up."
4,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"But she's got less than two minutes of runtime left."
4,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"With her new IQ, it could be enough."
4,4,CAT,0.000000,"So, what is it?"
4,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I've never seen one before -- no one has -- but I'm guessing it's a white hole."
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"A white hole?"
4,4,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. A black hole sucks time and matter out of the universe: a white hole returns it."
4,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"So, that thing's spewing time back into the universe?"
4,4,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Precisely. That's why we're experiencing these curious time phenomena on board."
4,4,CAT,0.000000,"So, what is it?"
4,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I've never seen one before -- no one has -- but I'm guessing it's a white hole."
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"A white hole?"
4,4,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. A black hole sucks time and matter out of the universe: a white hole returns it."
4,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"So, that thing's spewing time back into the universe?"
4,4,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Precisely. That's why we're experiencing these curious time phenomena on board."
4,4,LISTER,0.000000,"What time phenomena?"
4,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Like just then, when time repeated itself."
4,4,CAT,0.000000,"So, what is it?"
4,4,CAT,0.000000,"Only joking."
4,4,LISTER,0.500000,"Okay, so it's decided then. We consult Holly."
4,4,CAT,-1.000000,"Hey, wait a minute -- I missed the discussion!"
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"We all did."
4,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Time is occurring in random pockets. The laws of causality no longer apply. An action no longer leads to a consequence."
4,4,CAT,0.000000,"So, what is it?"
4,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I think we've experienced this period of time before, Sir."
4,4,CAT,0.000000,"Only joking."
4,4,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"And that one. Since we're no longer affected by the laws of causality, we can override these time jumps if we concentrate."
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Look, the only way out of this is to consult Holly."
4,4,CAT,0.000000,"I'll go with that."
4,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Gets my vote."
4,4,LISTER,0.500000,"Okay, so it's decided then. We consult Holly."
4,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Ah, I think we've just encountered the middle of this conversation!"
4,4,CAT,0.000000,"So, what is it?"
4,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Ooh, someone punch him out. Bring Holly up."
4,4,KRYTEN,0.500000,"She only has two minutes left. Perhaps I should talk to her."
4,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Leave this to me, Kryten.  On."
4,4,RIMMER,-0.400000,"White hole. Spewing time. Engines dead. Air supply low. Advise please."
4,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"Excuse me?"
4,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"White hole. Spewing time. Engines dead.--"
4,4,HOLLY,-1.000000,"I can't understand a word you're saying."
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"White."
4,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"Yes."
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Hole."
4,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"Right."
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Spewing."
4,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"Yes."
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Time."
4,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"With you."
4,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Engines dead."
4,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"Oh."
4,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Air supply low."
4,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"Ah."
4,4,RIMMER,1.000000,"Advise please."
4,4,HOLLY,0.000000,"Right."
4,4,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"It's a computer slug. From the format, it looks like it's compatible with Starbug's navicomp."
4,4,CAT,0.000000,"So, what is it?"
4,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I've never seen one before -- no one has -- but I'm guessing it's a white hole."
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"A white hole?"
4,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Every action has an equal and opposite--"
4,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Should be getting something now, Sir."
4,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah."
4,4,KRYTEN,1.000000,"It's the most audacious piece of astronavigation in the entire history of the Universe."
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"I don't understand."
4,4,KRYTEN,1.000000,"It's quite straightforward, Sir."
4,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Starbug is going to fire a thermonuclear device into this sun here..."
4,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"...creating a solar flare which is going to knock that planet..."
4,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"...out of orbit, and sending it rocketing across space and into the white hole, presumably blocking it up."
4,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"Let me get this straight. Is she doing what I think she's doing?"
4,4,CAT,-0.500000,"Why? What DO you think she's doing?"
4,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Playing pool with planets."
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Is that possible?"
4,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"Well, it's not going to work. It's completely insane. It's whacko. It's noodle-doodle."
4,4,CAT,1.000000,"I'm with you, buddy."
4,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"No, not the idea, the shot. There's not enough side."
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,""Side?""
4,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah, side-spin. It's a complete mis-cue."
4,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"What are you drivelling about, Lister? We're talking about a computer with an IQ in excess of twelve thousand."
4,4,LISTER,-0.200000,"Doesn't mean she can play pool. I can. Trust me. I know whereof I speak. Aigburth Arms on a Friday night. They used to call me Dave "Cinzano Bianco" Lister 'cause once I was on the table, you couldn't get rid of me. This pool arm is as sound as a dollarpound, and I promise you that shot will not come off. She's topped it, that's what she's done, she's topped it! It's a felt-ripper! That planet is off the table and into somebody's pint of beer."
4,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"We are talking about the trigonomics of four-dimensional space, you simple-minded gimboid! We are not talking about some seedy game of pool in a backstreet Scouse drinking pit."
4,4,LISTER,0.000000,"It's the same principle."
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Of course it isn't!"
4,4,LISTER,0.500000,"Rimmer, I promise you, THAT is a complete mis-cue. I say we chuck Holly's coordinates in the bin and let ME take the shot."
4,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Well, I say we put it to the vote. On one hand, we have a computer, with an IQ in excess of twelve thousand, who has a total grasp of astrophysics. And on the other hand, we have Lister, who, and let's be fair to him, is a complete gimp. To whom do we entrust our lives, the safety of this vessel and the future of everything? If it's a tie, we go with Holly. What's your vote, Lister?"
4,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well, I vote for Dave "Cinzano Bianco" Lister."
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"One-nil to Listypoos. I vote for Holly. Cat?"
4,4,CAT,-1.000000,"Well, I agree with you, buddy. But I'm voting for Doodoo Breath. The thing is, even though you're right, I could not bring myself to vote for someone with your dress sense. I couldn't put my cross next to the Bri-nylon party."
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Down to you, Kryten."
4,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well, I agree it's insane and suicidal, Sir, but I'm afraid I have to side with the human."
4,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Brutal!"
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"You're voting for El Dirtball?"
4,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"It's in my programming, Sir. A living human outranks a hologram. I'm sorry."
4,4,LISTER,0.500000,"Three-one to me! Let's do it!"
4,4,RIMMER,0.500000,"Congratulations, Kryten. Your vote has just killed everyone."
4,4,CAT,0.000000,"Will you relax? I've seen Gerbil-Face play down in the Recreation Room. He's a diva! He can knock those striped balls around the table all night long, and I tell you what, I have never once seen him lose a single ball down one of those holes!"
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"How many of those are you going to drink?"
4,4,LISTER,0.000000,"I told you not to talk. Game on."
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"You're going to drink an entire six-pack of wicked-strength lager?"
4,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"I'm not gonna get plastered, Rimmer, just ... just nicely drunk."
4,4,RIMMER,0.500000,"Define "nicely drunk." Is "nicely drunk" horizontal or perpendicular?"
4,4,LISTER,1.000000,"Rimmer, I can handle it."
4,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I'm not sure I can."
4,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"We're in the wrong position. It's an easier shot if we go over here."
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"But that's right in the orbital path of the planet! If you miss, we're going to get a planet in the face."
4,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"I'm not gonna mish."
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,""Mish?""
4,4,LISTER,0.000000,"What?"
4,4,RIMMER,-0.333333,"You said "mish." "I'm not gonna mish," you said. You've only had two cans and you're steaming!"
4,4,LISTER,-0.333333,"Rimmer, will you relax? I know what I'm doing! I am not pished!"
4,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"He's missed."
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"We're finished!"
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"What the smeg is going on?"
4,4,LISTER,1.000000,"She rides!"
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"You jammy goit!"
4,4,LISTER,1.000000,"Played for, and got!"
4,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Surely not, Sir!"
4,4,CAT,-1.000000,"Are you trying to say that was a trick shot?"
4,4,LISTER,0.250000,"Intended! Pool God! King of the Cues! Prince of the Planet-Potters!"
4,4,HOLLY,-0.500000,"'Ere, what's goin' on? Where are we?"
4,4,HOLLY,1.000000,"What happened to that plan to make me brilliant again?"
4,4,KRYTEN,-0.666667,"Of course! Blocking up the white hole has eradicated its influence! The time it spewed into the universe no longer exists."
4,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Meaning?"
4,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Well, basically, we occupy a redundant timeline. Reviving the toaster, making Holly a genius; none of this is going to have happened."
4,4,RIMMER,-0.333333,"What about us? Are we just going to pop out of existence? Just going to cease to be?"
4,4,KRYTEN,-1.200000,"We will cease to be HERE, because none of this will have occurred. But we will exist back on Red Dwarf, before all this began. With, of course, no memory of these events, which, of course, never happened. And as these events never happened, we will have no memory of them. In which case, Mister Rimmer, Sir, I should like to take this opportunity of saying that you are the most obnoxious, trumped-up, farty little smeghead it has ever been my misfortune to encounter!"
4,5,CAT,0.000000,"Ah, welcome home, son. You've been in all of our prayers, you know?"
4,5,CAT,0.000000,"He's pulled t'rough. Be on his feet in no time, t'anks to you. Sitting by his bedside day after day, night after night, holding his hand, reading him stories..."
4,5,CAT,1.000000,"Well, thank you, son."
4,5,CAT,0.000000,"Mmm.  What a guy!"
4,5,CAT,1.000000,"God speed and bless you, son!"
4,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Lights!"
4,5,LISTER,0.000000,"What?"
4,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"What are you doing?"
4,5,LISTER,0.000000,"What are we doing?"
4,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Yes, what are you doing?"
4,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Just nipping down to the cinema, to catch the midnight movie."
4,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"What, dressed like that?"
4,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah. Going to see Jaws."
4,5,RIMMER,-0.333333,"You're going fishing, aren't you? That ocean planet we passed two days ago. You're going fishing without me."
4,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Oh, come off it, man. Don't be ridiculous."
4,5,CAT,-0.500000,"Hey, what are you doing with the lights on? Come on, let's get out of here before --"
4,5,RIMMER,-0.500000,"I don't believe it. All three of you."
4,5,CAT,0.000000,"What's he talking about?"
4,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"I dunno. For some reason he's got this crazy, wacked-out idea that we're all going on a fishing holiday."
4,5,CAT,0.000000,"A fishing holiday?!"
4,5,RIMMER,0.000000,""Dear Rimmer, We have gone on a fishing holiday to the ocean planet we passed two days ago. We tried to wake you but couldn't. See you in three weeks. Lister, Kryten, and Cat.""
4,5,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"Oh, please, sir. They forced me to do it. I had no choice."
4,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Kryten!"
4,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Why did you want to go without me?"
4,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"We didn't want to go without you. We just thought it wasn't your scene. I mean, fishing, that's boring, isn't it?"
4,5,RIMMER,1.000000,"I love fishing! The glow of the dawn, the line arcing into the water..."
4,5,LISTER,-0.333333,"That's it! That's exactly the reason we didn't invite you. There's no fish."
4,5,KRYTEN,0.000000,"That, at least, is true, sir. We sent down a search probe and there is no marine life on the entire planet."
4,5,LISTER,-2.000000,"We're just gonna sit out on Starbug, dangle the rods over the side and have a few cans, you know, chill out."
4,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I don't believe anybody'd want to go on a fishing holiday where they know there's no fish."
4,5,LISTER,-0.428571,"What, we used to do it all the time, back home. We used to go down to the canal. Never any fish in that! We used to go condom fishing. I swear! One time I caught this two-pound black ribbed nobler! It was about that big!"
4,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Why didn't you just say, "Dear Rimmer, We're going on a fishing holiday and we don't want you to come?""
4,5,CAT,1.000000,"See, that's what I said we should say!"
4,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Shh!"
4,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I don't know what it is about me. All my life, it's been the same old story. It's not easy, you know, to come in every night, look in that mirror, and see a guy nobody likes."
4,5,CAT,0.500000,"How do you think we feel? We got to look at it all day!"
4,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Look, we just thought you wouldn't want to come."
4,5,RIMMER,-0.125000,"I tried to be liked, god knows I tried. I regaled you with amusing stories of when I was treasurer of the Hammond Organ Owners' Society. You never laugh. I offer to talk you through my photo collection of 20th century telegraph poles. You've always got some excuse! None of you like morris dancing! Would that break your hearts, every once in a while, the four of us getting our knees in the air -- the jingle of bells, the clonk of wood on wood? But no, every time I suggest it you all pretend to be ill."
4,5,LISTER,-0.600000,"You've got it wrong, man. We just thought you wouldn't want to come. Now we know you do, great, you can come. The way you're going on about it, it's like some major conspiracy, we've been planning it for days. We haven't."
4,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Really?"
4,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Really."
4,5,RIMMER,0.333333,"All right, then, I'll come. I'll just get changed. Holly?"
4,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"Oh, who woke him up?"
4,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Steady now, Kryten."
4,5,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Yes, sir."
4,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Best to get there in one piece than to rush it and cause an accident, eh?"
4,5,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I have passed my test, sir; I am a fully qualified pilot."
4,5,RIMMER,1.000000,"Mind that star!"
4,5,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Wha- That star is over two light years away, sir. We're nowhere near it!"
4,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"There's no percentage in being a boy racer, Kryten. Okay, you've passed your test -- Mind that planet!"
4,5,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Which planet?"
4,5,RIMMER,1.000000,"That planet!"
4,5,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"That's- That's the planet we're heading to, sir."
4,5,RIMMER,0.333333,"Excellent. Excellent. Plot an orbital course, we'll be there in no time."
4,5,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Yes, sir, I have done, sir."
4,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Yes, and get the second stage under way."
4,5,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I already have done, sir."
4,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"But you haven't correlated the data with the main computer banks, have you?"
4,5,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Yes, sir, I have, sir."
4,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"You know- You now your trouble, Kryten?"
4,5,KRYTEN,0.000000,"What, sir?"
4,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"You're a git."
4,5,CAT,0.000000,"Stupid. Three weeks stuck with Captain Yawn."
4,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Look, it wasn't my fault. I could've sweet-talked our way out of it if you hadn't've blown the whole gaffe."
4,5,CAT,0.000000,"Me? What did I do?"
4,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"I could've sweet-talked my way out of it, but oh, no, you had to come blundering in with your size 12's."
4,5,CAT,-0.500000,"You are so two-faced! Why haven't you got the guts just to tell the dude nobody likes him?"
4,5,LISTER,0.400000,"Oh, yeah, great. Brilliant. What'm I supposed to say? "Excuse me, man. D'you know you're about as popular as a horny dog at a Miss Lovely Legs competition?""
4,5,CAT,-0.500000,"That's what I'd do! I'd say -- Hi, buddy, how's it goin'?"
4,5,RIMMER,-0.200000,"Agh, I just had to get out of there. He's driving me nuts! I cannot stand front-seat drivers. Well, come on, there's not a lot going on in here. We're on holiday! Let's cheer things up a bit. How 'bout some music? I've brought my Hammond CD's with me. How about "Reggie Wilson plays the Lift Music Classics?" What about "Sounds of the Supermarket: 20 Shopping Greats?""
4,5,CAT,-1.000000,"Has anyone seen the keys to the medical cabinet? I feel a sudden urge to suffocate myself with a two-pound black ribbed nobler."
4,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Not Reggie Wilson, please, Rimmer."
4,5,RIMMER,-0.666667,"You don't like Reggie Wilson? What? Not even "Pop goes Delius" or "Funking up Wagner?""
4,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"I prefer something slightly more melodious, like the long, drawn- out death rattle of a man suffering from terminal flatulence."
4,5,RIMMER,-0.166667,"Come on, you bores. Let's do something. How about we all sing campfire songs?  Kumbaya, my Lord, Kumbaya -- Everyone! Kryten! -- Kumbaya, Kumbaya."
4,5,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Purple alert, purple alert!"
4,5,LISTER,0.000000,"What's a purple alert?"
4,5,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Well, it's sort of like, not as bad as a red alert, but a bit worse than a blue alert. Kind of like a mauve alert, don't want to say "mauve alert.""
4,5,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Holly! Wipe the rabid foam from your chin and start again."
4,5,HOLLY,0.333333,"There's some sort of disruption to the time-fabric continuum. At least, I presume that's what it is, it's certainly got all the signs. There's this big wibbly-wobbly swirly thing that's headed straight towards us."
4,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"What is it?"
4,5,KRYTEN,0.333333,"I don't know, sir. Whichever way I maneuver it follows us! It seems to be locked in on us. Wait -- there's something coming out of it. It's going to hit us! Collision course!"
4,5,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Good god! Emergency, emergency! Adopt crash procedure!"
4,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Where's the card? Who's got the card?!"
4,5,LISTER,0.000000,"What card?"
4,5,RIMMER,1.000000,"The plastic card, the plastic card with the cartoons of the crash procedure on it!"
4,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Don't panic, man!"
4,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"It should be in the netting behind the seats. Haven't we got to sit behind a woman clutching a baby? What's the drill?!"
4,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Look, I know what is it!"
4,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"What?"
4,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Sit down, tuck your head between your legs and brace yourself."
4,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Now what?"
4,5,LISTER,-0.750000,"Then you open the in-flight magazine and start reading. Thing is*, the articles act as a sedative. I mean, look at this: "Contents List: Salt, an Epicure's Delight; Classic Wines of Estonia; Flemish Weaving the Traditional Way." Don't fight it, man, let it take you."
4,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"How can you be so mind-bogglingly flippant? Don't you know what's going to happen? We're going to crash!"
4,5,LISTER,1.000000,"You've got to stay calm! It's a well-known fact, the more relaxed you are, the less likely you are to be injured."
4,5,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Good luck, everybody, here it comes!"
4,5,LISTER,1.000000,"The ancient Egyptians were great believers in salt."
4,5,CAT,1.000000,"When most people think of classic wines, they are unlikely to consider the Estonian reds, yet Estonian grapes are among the fruitiest and most subtle."
4,5,RIMMER,1.000000,"Since the beginning of the 13th century, Belgium has been the home of some of the most remarkable weaving to come out of northwest Europe."
4,5,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Is everyone all right?"
4,5,RIMMER,1.000000,"Yes, thank god, I'm fine."
4,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Cat!"
4,5,CAT,-0.428571,"Oh, it's bad, buddy, it's real bad.  See what I mean?  Red with apricot. I look like a jerk. I'm bleeding an unfashionable color. If I'd known I was going to get my leg crushed I'd've worn white. It goes with everything."
4,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Is anything broken?"
4,5,CAT,0.666667,"Yeah. All the stitching's come away, and the lining's ripped. Somebody, please, get me a tailor!"
4,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Kryten, get the First Aid box. We have to clean this up, make sure he doesn't get gangrene."
4,5,CAT,0.000000,"Gangrene? You think I might get gangrene?"
4,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah."
4,5,CAT,-0.500000,"Hey, that might work! Green with apricot -- I think I could pull that off!"
4,5,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"It's a break, sir. Quite a bad one. I'm going to have to snap the bone back into line, and there's no anaesthetic."
4,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Here, read the in-flight magazine."
4,5,CAT,0.000000,""Salt: an epicure's delight. The salt on a typ--" Oooh, my god!"
4,5,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Did it hurt?"
4,5,CAT,0.000000,"No, I'm talking about the article! Have you done my leg yet?"
4,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Holly, what's the damage?"
4,5,HOLLY,-1.500000,"It doesn't look good. We've lost the port engine, the starboard engine's packed up, the fuel line's severed, we're taking in water through the hull, we've lost the landing jets, half the electric's out, and the elastic's snapped on the furry dice."
4,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"What does that mean in real terms?"
4,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"Well, it means you got a more tasteful cockpit. but unless you fix that starboard engine in the next 40 minutes we're going to start sinking."
4,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Anything we can do?"
4,5,HOLLY,-1.000000,"We could try to hire a dance band and get it to play "Abide With Me.""
4,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"I'm going to have to go out there and fix the engine."
4,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"You don't know anything about engines!"
4,5,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Besides, there's a 40-knot gale out there. You'd have to be insane to even attempt it. Only a fool or a hero would even consider it."
4,5,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Uh, Kryten, sir."
4,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Eh?"
4,5,LISTER,0.500000,"Lister. Dave Lister."
4,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"He hasn't got a name; we just call him Cat."
4,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"Holly."
4,5,LISTER,0.000000,"He's a hologram. He can't touch anything."
4,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"You're me?"
4,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I haven't got one."
4,5,LISTER,0.500000,"Yeah, okay, count me in. I've got a window in my schedule this afternoon."
4,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"No, I wasn't."
4,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"What's that?"
4,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"I don't know."
4,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"I don't know!"
4,5,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Sir, can I have a word in private?"
4,5,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well, I have a limited understanding of medicine, sir, but it's plainly obvious even to me that your left arm is broken in several places."
4,5,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"I cannot allow you to go out in this storm, sir. Not with your arm in that condition. I must insist you allow me to go in your place."
4,5,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"That's besides the point, sir."
4,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"How?"
4,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"No."
4,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Eh?"
4,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"I like rasta* Billy Skank."
4,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Whether you like OBrasta,* Billy..."
4,5,CAT,0.666667,"Paisley with stripes. That's nice. Green anoraks with fuzzy collars, they're great."
4,5,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Oh, sir! He's delirious!"
4,5,CAT,0.000000,"Oh, rubber trousers, held down with bicycle clips. Wow!"
4,5,RIMMER,0.000000,""Commander Rimmer!" I ask you. "Ace!" Barf city. I bet you anything he wears women's underwear. They're all the same, this type, you know, Hurly-burly, rough-n-tumble macho marines in public, and behind closed doors he'll be parading up and down in taffeta ballgowns, drinking mint juleps, whipping the houseboy."
4,5,KRYTEN,0.500000,"Sir, he's you! It's just that your lives diverged at a certain point in time."
4,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Yes, I went into the gents and he went the other way."
4,5,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"I assume, sir, you are making fatuous references to his sexuality. If I may point out, if --"
4,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Yes! We did it!"
4,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Come on, Ace, it was you! I could never have reconnected that fuel line."
4,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well how could you hang upside down and fix the starboard engine? It was totally brutal!"
4,5,LISTER,1.000000,"What a team!"
4,5,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Now I know where I've seen you two! Weren't you the double- action centerfold in July's issue of "Big Boys in Boots?""
4,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Skipper?"
4,5,RIMMER,0.000000,""Ace and Skipper?" You sound like a kid's TV series about a boy and his bush kangaroo!"
4,5,RIMMER,1.000000,"Yeah, the sooner we get back the sooner you two can climb into a nice, hot, soapy bath and play "spot the submarine.""
4,5,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Sir -- the Cat -- I don't think he's going to last much longer!"
4,5,CAT,0.333333,"Bry* nylon underwear. Sock suspenders. Suits with cardigans!"
4,5,KRYTEN,0.333333,"Oh, sir, he's delirious! His leg's all swollen. I- I think he may lose it."
4,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Lose his leg?!"
4,5,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"I fear so. The operation to save it is beyond my expertise."
4,5,CAT,-1.000000,"Lose my leg? Hey, that's terrible. None of my suits will fit!"
4,5,RIMMER,1.000000,"Oh, my god!"
4,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"I'll go and throw up."
4,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"How's the Cat?"
4,5,LISTER,-0.125000,"Oh, Ace did it. Cat's fine now, he's just sitting up in bed looking through some swatches. Trying to find the material he likes for his dressings. I don't know how Ace does it. He's been on his feet for 36 hours, he's still laughing and joking. What a guy. He's just nipped off to teach Kryten how to play the piano. Amazing dude."
4,5,RIMMER,1.000000,"So, is it simple registry office, or a full church do for you two?"
4,5,LISTER,0.000000,"I don't understand your attitude, Rimmer. He's you!"
4,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"He's not me, I'm me. He's a me who had all the luck, all the chances. all the breaks that I never got."
4,5,LISTER,0.000000,"No, it was just a single incident. And your lives went off in completely different directions. It's incredible to think that one decision in your childhood could produce such drastically different people."
4,5,RIMMER,0.666667,"Right. He probably got to go to some really great school, while I was lumbered with Io House. He got to meet all the right people, greased his way up the old boy network, towel-flicked his way into the Space Corps, Masonic-handshook his way into flight school, and brown- tongued his way up the ranks."
4,5,LISTER,0.000000,"You'd think you'd be pleased that somewhere, in some other dimension, there's another you, another you doing really well for himself."
4,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Oh, come on. How'd you feel if some git arrived from another dimension, another Lister, with wall-to-wall charisma and a Ph.D. in being handsome and wonderful?"
4,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Hey, man, I am that Lister!"
4,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"No, come on, how would you feel if there was another Lister doing a hell of a lot better that you are?"
4,5,LISTER,-0.125000,"There is! Ace knows him. That's why he called me Spanners when he first came in. In Ace's dimension, he's a flight engineer in the Space Corps, married to Christine Kochanski, twin boys, Jim and Bexon*. I made up for him! Whatever he did that I didn't, he deserves the lot. For me it makes sense, him having all this stuff. To think that in every dimension, every possibility is played out -- hell, there's probably a really, really weird dimension where you're better-looking than me."
4,5,RIMMER,-0.666667,"Well, it just makes me bitter. You know I've always had this thing about not getting the breaks. Well, there's living proof of what I could've achieved if I'd gotten the one he got."
4,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Go on, he's probably picked a ring."
4,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Why?"
4,5,LISTER,0.000000,"So where're you going to go?"
4,5,LISTER,-0.250000,"Well, good luck, man. And, look, don't be too hard on Rimmer. You got the break, he didn't. He's just bitter."
4,5,LISTER,-0.500000,"And that's the only difference? Rimmer went down a year, and you stayed up?"
4,5,LISTER,0.000000,"While he spent the rest of his life making excuses."
4,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Ha, hah.  Ready?  I'll smoke him a smegging kipper."
4,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Now!"
4,6,RIMMER,-0.714286,"So there we were at 2:30 in the morning; I was beginning to wish I had never come to cadet training school. To the south lay water -- there was no way we could cross that. To the east and west two armies squeezed us in a pincer. The only way was north; I had to go for it and pray the Gods were smiling on me. I picked up the dice and threw two sixes. Caldecott couldn't believe it. My go again; another two sixes!"
4,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"Rimmer, what's wrong with you? Don't you realize that no one is even slightly interested in anything you're saying? You've got this major psychological defect which blinds you to the fact that you're boring people to death! How come you can't sense that?"
4,6,RIMMER,0.500000,"Anyway I picked up the dice again... Unbelievable! Another two sixes!"
4,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Rimmer!"
4,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"What?"
4,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"No one wants to know some stupid story about how you beat your Cadet School Training Officer at Risk."
4,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Then -- disaster! I threw a two and a three; Caldecott picked up the dice and threw snake eyes -- I was still in it."
4,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Cat, can you talk to him?."
4,6,CAT,0.000000,"What?"
4,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Anyway, to cut a long story short I threw a five and a four which beat his three and a two, another double six followed by a double four and a double five. After he'd thrown a three and a two I threw a six and a three."
4,6,CAT,-1.000000,"Man, this guy could bore for his country!"
4,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"What I want to know, is how the smeg can you remember what dice you threw at a game you played when you were seventeen?"
4,6,RIMMER,-0.666667,"I jotted it down in my Risk campaign book. I always used to do that so I could replay my moments of glory over a glass of brandy in the sleeping quarters. I ask you, what better way is there to spend a Saturday night?"
4,6,CAT,1.000000,"Ya got me."
4,6,RIMMER,1.000000,"So a six and a three and he came back with a three and a two."
4,6,LISTER,-0.666667,"Rimmer, can't you tell the story is not gripping me? I'm in a state of non-grippedness, I am completely smegging ungripped. Shut the smeg up."
4,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Don't you want to hear the Risk story?"
4,6,LISTER,0.000000,"That's what I've been saying for the last fifteen minutes."
4,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"But I thought that was because I hadn't got to the really interesting bit..."
4,6,LISTER,1.000000,"What really interesting bit?"
4,6,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Ah well, that was about two hours later, after he'd thrown a three and a two and I'd thrown a four and a one. I picked up the dice..."
4,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Hang on Rimmer, hang on... the really interesting bit is exactly the same as the dull bit."
4,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"You don't know what I did with the dice though, do you? For all you know, I could have jammed them up his nostrils, head butted him on the nose and they could have blasted out of his ears. That would've been quite interesting."
4,6,LISTER,0.000000,"OK, Rimmer. What did you do with the dice?."
4,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"I threw a five and a two."
4,6,LISTER,1.000000,"And that's the really interesting bit?"
4,6,RIMMER,1.000000,"Well it was interesting to me, it got me into Irkutsk."
4,6,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Hmmm, curious..."
4,6,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Extraordinary!"
4,6,KRYTEN,1.000000,"What a truly copacetic piece of machinery."
4,6,LISTER,0.000000,"What is it?"
4,6,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Well, basically it appears to be a device that converts an individual into digital information and then transmits him as light beams to another point in space. Essentially it's a matter--"
4,6,KRYTEN,0.500000,"--transporter. It's pretty neat."
4,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Ha!"
4,6,CAT,0.000000,"Where'd you get it from?"
4,6,KRYTEN,-0.600000,"I think it must be a prototype. I found it in the Research Labs down on Z deck. I managed to cobble together the missing circuitry and it appears to be fully functional. Theoretically it can transport several people at once.  Would you like to grip a paddle, sir?"
4,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"We'll meet you by the NaviComp in Starbug."
4,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Let's go."
4,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I'm sorry about that, sir. I neglected to engage the depth function."
4,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"We'll walk, Kryten. We'll walk."
4,6,CAT,-1.000000,"So, besides cutting down on shoe leather, what good is it?"
4,6,HOLLY,0.333333,"Exploration: it can take you anywhere. It can home in on atmosphere bearing planets within a radius of 500,000 light years. If there are any lifeforms in the local systems this thing'll take you straight to 'em."
4,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"So are there any planets with an atmosphere in range?"
4,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well, several according to the paddle's scanners, but the most interesting prospect appears to be 200,000 light years away. In the normal course of things it would take Starbug several billion years to reach it."
4,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"It wouldn't be so bad -- Rimmer could finish his Risk story."
4,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Traveling subspace via the paddle we would reach it almost instantaneously."
4,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well, what are we waiting for?"
4,6,CAT,-0.500000,"Ah ah ah! Nobody's rearranging my molecules."
4,6,KRYTEN,1.000000,"It's perfectly safe, sir, but I do suggest that Mr Rimmer and I go on ahead as a scout party."
4,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"What?"
4,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well, if the atmosphere isn't breatheable we won't be affected. If it is, we can send the paddle back to pick you up."
4,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"The thing is, Kryters, I would love to be in the advanced scout party facing all those thrilling unknown dangers with you, fighting a frontierman's path through a jungle of discovery, but you're forgetting one thing."
4,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"No sir, I've taken your congenital cowardliness into consideration."
4,6,RIMMER,-0.333333,"I'm a hologram. I can't touch the thing. How could it transport me?"
4,6,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Well, of course, you do have a small physical presence."
4,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Precisely. Holly, would you give me Mr Rimmer's light-bee, please."
4,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Wait a minute."
4,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Where am I?"
4,6,LISTER,0.000000,"This is Rimmer?."
4,6,HOLLY,1.000000,"Yeah, it buzzes around inside him and projects his image."
4,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"My God, that was disgusting!"
4,6,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Please sir, that's a very sophisticated piece of hardware--"
4,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Really? Anyone fancy a game of squash?"
4,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Sir!"
4,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Thank you. Now, if all goes well the paddle will re-materialise here. Simply press this green key and you'll be transported down to the planet, a safe distance from us."
4,6,LISTER,0.000000,"OK."
4,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"What is this place?"
4,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well I can't pinpoint our location precisely but, ah, the atmosphere is indeed breathable I'll return the paddle."
4,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"What now?"
4,6,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Well, I suggest we start to run, sir. I suggest we ambulate as fast as the local gravity will allow."
4,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Why?"
4,6,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Because of them, sir."
4,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Sir?"
4,6,LISTER,1.000000,"Must be safe, let's go."
4,6,LISTER,0.000000,"So long--"
4,6,LISTER,1.000000,"--Suckers!"
4,6,CAT,0.000000,"Get us out of here."
4,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Don't panic me, man! I'm doing my best!"
4,6,CAT,0.000000,"Where are we?"
4,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Don't know."
4,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Stone; We're in some kind of narrow stone passage way."
4,6,CAT,0.000000,"So what do we do?"
4,6,LISTER,0.000000,"I can see daylight. I don't know, we could just stand around here I suppose, 'til we work out were we are."
4,6,LISTER,0.000000,"At least we're out of trouble."
4,6,CAT,0.000000,"Who were those guys?"
4,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well the short one with the stupid 'tache was Hitler, and the jerky one with the child molester glasses that was Goebbels; suppose the fat bastard must've been Goering. Must've been. He was a cocaine addict and a transvestite {some thing}. If things'd worked out different he had the makings of a major movie star."
4,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Think I've just worked out were we are."
4,6,CAT,0.000000,"You seriously telling me he's a transvestite?"
4,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah..."
4,6,CAT,0.000000,"With those hips?"
4,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"I think we've lost them."
4,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I can't tell you how feeble and improbable those creatures were, sir. I've seen more convincing dinosaurs given away free with a packet of Wheaty Flakes. There's something wrong here..."
4,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Which way?"
4,6,CAT,0.000000,"What do you think these guys are gonna do to us?"
4,6,LISTER,0.000000,"What ever it takes to find out about the paddle."
4,6,CAT,-1.000000,"Hey, if you mean torture, then say the word torture -- I can take it!"
4,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"OK, then, they'll torture us."
4,6,CAT,0.000000,"Waaaaah! Torture us! Waaaaaah!"
4,6,LISTER,-0.333333,"Probably won't, man. They're probably not even interested in the paddle. They'll probably just take us outside and execute us."
4,6,CAT,-0.500000,"You're just saying that to make me feel better. It's just those guys are fiends. They instantly know your weak spots. As soon as they see me they only have to force me into platform shoes and flared trousers and I'll sing like Tweety Pie."
4,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"Dunno what the smeg went wrong. Kryten never said anything about the paddle taking us back in time. Just supposed to transport us to the nearest planet with a breathable atmosphere. How the smeg did we wind up in the middle of the Third Reich?"
4,6,CAT,0.000000,"What are those guys doing out there?."
4,6,LISTER,1.000000,"Building something."
4,6,CAT,0.000000,"What?"
4,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Oh nothing, nothing. Just a sculpture, you know, a modern art job. The kind you get in shopping malls."
4,6,CAT,0.000000,"What's it made of?"
4,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"Wood. It's a sort of inverted L shape in wood."
4,6,CAT,-0.500000,"Does it have a kind of rope motif?."
4,6,LISTER,1.000000,"There's a sort of noose theme to it, yeah."
4,6,CAT,0.000000,"Its gallows, right? Look, if it's gallows, say it's gallows -- I can take it."
4,6,LISTER,0.000000,"OK, it's gallows."
4,6,CAT,0.000000,"Waaaaah! They're building a gallows! They're hanging us! Waaaaah!"
4,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Look man, don't panic. We're gonna escape."
4,6,CAT,0.000000,"How?"
4,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Just... hijack the guards when they come in, nick their uniforms and stroll out."
4,6,CAT,-0.666667,"Are you insane? Do you seriously expect me to wear grey out of season? I'd rather hang."
4,6,LISTER,-0.333333,"Hang on, hang on. Something's happening. Some kind of parade or drill but..."
4,6,CAT,0.000000,"But what?"
4,6,LISTER,-0.333333,"Hang on. These guys aren't Nazis -- they're all wearing different period costumes. There's one looks like Al Capone, there's another like Mussolini, Richard III, Napoleon. Smeg, it's like all the worst people in history have been brought together in one place. Oh my God, there's James Last! I recognize him from Rimmer's record collection."
4,6,CAT,0.000000,"What are they doing?."
4,6,LISTER,-0.400000,"Well, just lining up in ... in some kind of firing squad. Woah Woah! Hang on, hang on. Someone's being brought out, they're tying him to a stake. It's Winnie the Pooh."
4,6,CAT,0.000000,"What?"
4,6,LISTER,1.000000,"Winnie the Pooh, I swear! He's refusing the blindfold."
4,6,CAT,0.000000,"They're tying Winnie the Pooh to a stake?"
4,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"That's something no one should ever have to see."
4,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Errr, could someone tell me what's going on here?"
4,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Wax droids?"
4,6,KRYTEN,0.500000,"Of course! This whole place, the entire complex, is a colossal wax droid theme park.  See Prehistoric World? That must be where we materialized, and on either side Villain World and Hero World."
4,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"But I thought wax droids were programmed to repeat a simple sequence of routines over and over again."
4,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well, they must have broken their programming, and now they're running amok."
4,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"A war?"
4,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Where's the rest of your army?"
4,6,RIMMER,-0.500000,"And you're all that's left. Just a smattering of intellectuals, pacifists, and celebrities."
4,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Ah. Who do the enemy have?"
4,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"My God, Kryten, this is my destiny! I was born for this moment!"
4,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I'm not sure I'm following you, sir."
4,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Across that valley lies an army of darkness such as mankind has never seen. The only thing between them and total victory is this pathetic pocket of resistance without a leader, without a plan, and into this bleak arena steps a man; the man for the moment."
4,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Who?"
4,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Me! Who did you think, Pat Boone?"
4,6,RIMMER,-0.200000,"Gentlemen! Ladies! Assemble your troops for inspection at 1500 hours! Together with my valiant adjutant, Kryten, I'm gonna turn you into the meanest, fittest fighting machine that ever graced a battlefield. Come on, Kryten."
4,6,LISTER,0.000000,"What's the point of this war?"
4,6,CAT,-1.000000,"Hey, buddy, we just {something}."
4,6,CAT,0.000000,"Who is this guy?"
4,6,LISTER,0.500000,"I think he was a famous Roman Emperor. He slept with his mother, both his sisters, and ended up eating his son."
4,6,CAT,0.000000,"Hey, a little advice, bud: we all feel peckish after making love but most of us settle for pizza."
4,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Dunno who the other one is."
4,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"Don't know. If I did, I wouldn't be here."
4,6,LISTER,1.000000,"Hang on, it's got something to do with travelling across sub space."
4,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well, like I said, I don't really know."
4,6,LISTER,1.666667,"Hang on, I'll try my best! I'll try my best! Just give it here."
4,6,CAT,0.000000,"Shall we take a quick vote?"
4,6,LISTER,1.000000,"Shut up!"
4,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Now!"
4,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Come on, let's get out of here."
4,6,RIMMER,1.000000,"What a challenge -- the greatest minds in military history against me! Let's pray they're up to it."
4,6,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Are you sure your sanity chip is fully screwed in, sir? Have you any conception of what's lining up outside for your inspection?"
4,6,RIMMER,-0.666667,"I'll soon shake them up. By God, I only wish the guys from the Io Amateur Wargamers and Recreaters of the Battle of Neasden Society could see me now. They'd choke on their pikestaffs."
4,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"As you were, Sergeant Presley."
4,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Well done, Presley."
4,6,RIMMER,1.000000,"Kryten, let's see what we've got, eh?"
4,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"What's your name, soldier?"
4,6,KRYTEN,1.000000,"His name's Gandhi, sir, Mahatma Ghandi."
4,6,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Well, get him out of that damm nappy and into a uniform. Have you no pride man? Don't you want to win this war? Don't eyeball me, Ghandi. Get on the floor and give me 50, NOW!!."
4,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Theresa, sir, Mother Theresa."
4,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Assisi, sir, Saint Francis of Assisi"
4,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"There's only two kinds from Assisi, steers and queers -- which are you, boy?"
4,6,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Ah! Moving hastily on, sir."
4,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"What's *he* doing here?"
4,6,KRYTEN,1.000000,"He was posted here from the fiction section."
4,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"The Dalai Lama."
4,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Queen Victoria."
4,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Mr Noel Coward."
4,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Shut up."
4,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Ah, Monsieur Jean-Paul Sartre, sir."
4,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Who?"
4,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"He's a philosopher, sir -- an existentialist."
4,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Well, Sartre, we don't like existentialists around here, and we certainly don't like French philosophers poncing around in their black polo necks filling everyone's heads with their theories about the bleakness of existence and absurdity of the cosmos, clear?"
4,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I'm watching you, Gandhi."
4,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"You're driving them too hard, sir."
4,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"It's my job to drive them hard, Kryten."
4,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Three of them have melted from exhaustion."
4,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Perhaps I have been a bit too tough, but it's for their own good."
4,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"You're killing them for their own good?"
4,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Look, when they get out on that battlefield, don't they think the enemy are going to try and kill them?"
4,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"They won't need to -- you will have wiped them all out first."
4,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I know what I'm doing, Kryten. We attack tomorrow under cover of daylight."
4,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Daylight, sir?"
4,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"It's the last thing they'll be expecting -- a daylight charge over the minefield."
4,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"The what-field?"
4,6,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Obviously, I'll have to coordinate things from back here. Now, this is the plan."
4,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Rimmer!"
4,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Listy! Welcome to command centre."
4,6,LISTER,-0.333333,"Rimmer, what's going on out there? Isn't that Mahatma Gandhi? And what's he doing practising hand to hand combat with a nun?"
4,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"That's not a nun, Listy, that's Lieutenant Colonel Mother Theresa. She's a soldier now."
4,6,CAT,0.000000,"What are you doing, buddy?"
4,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I'm winning this war, that's what I'm doing, buddy. You won't believe what a ragamuffin bunch of lefty, wishy-washy liberals they were, before I knocked some good old fashinoned death-or-glory bloodlust into them."
4,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Rimmer, you've taken a group of holy men and pacifists and turned them into the Dirty Dozen!"
4,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Oh, I can't take *all* the credit -- couldn't have done it without Kryten here."
4,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I'm sorry, sirs, I had no choice. I'm programmed to obey, no matter how psychotic and deranged the human order."
4,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Rimmer, you're gonna get these guys wiped out, they're not soldiers!"
4,6,CAT,1.000000,"He's flipped."
4,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"With all respect, sir, he's right. I beg you to reconsider."
4,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"They're only wax droids."
4,6,LISTER,0.000000,"But Rimmer, they've broken their programming; they're capable of independent thought. That makes them alive, makes them practically people -- I'm not gonna let you do it."
4,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Pardon me?"
4,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"You 'eard me! If you can talk them into it, I can talk them out of it."
4,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"I see. Sar'nt Presley?"
4,6,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Place these gentlemen under arrest until further notice. If they resist, shoot them."
4,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Come on, Kryten."
4,6,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"Oh. He's been acting strangely ever since we landed here, sir. I think it might have affected his mind when you chewed his light bee."
4,6,LISTER,1.000000,"I'll do more than chew his light bee when we get out of here."
4,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"KRYTEEEEN!"
4,6,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Well... Don't know about the enemy, but you certainly scare the hell out of me. Let's get this show on the road."
4,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Kryten, you know what you have to do."
4,6,RIMMER,1.000000,"Let's go, Holly."
4,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"OK, matey."
4,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Iron Duke. Iron Duke. This is Pawn Sacrifice. Come in, please."
4,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Kryten -- how's it going?"
4,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I'm in the Third Reich building, minimal resistance. Just as you planned, the decoy charge has drawn their fire."
4,6,RIMMER,-0.500000,"OK. Now find the boiler room and hit the thermostat -- they'll melt once it hits 100 degrees."
4,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I'm on my way, sir."
4,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Victory, gentlemen! The fascists have fallen!"
4,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"May I untie them now, sir."
4,6,RIMMER,0.250000,"Rejoice! We conquer! Victory on Waxworld! It's VW day!"
4,6,LISTER,0.000000,"So you took the HQ Wiped them all out."
4,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"To a droid."
4,6,KRYTEN,1.000000,"It's true, all melted."
4,6,LISTER,0.000000,"What about Arnie's army?"
4,6,CAT,0.000000,"Yeah, how many of them made it back?"
4,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"There are always casualties in war, gentlemen. Otherwise it wouldn't be war, just be a rather nasty argument with a lot of pushing and shoving."
4,6,LISTER,0.000000,"So how many survived?"
4,6,RIMMER,-2.000000,"Well we haven't had time to make a full official estimate, but at a rough guess, and obviously this is subject to alteration pending information updates, roundabout none of them."
4,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"So you wiped out the entire population of this planet."
4,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"You make it sound so negative, Lister. Don't you see, the deranged menace that once threatened this world is vanquished!"
4,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"No it isn't, pal. You're still here."
4,6,RIMMER,1.000000,"I brought about peace. Peace, freedom and democracy."
4,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah, Rimmer. Right. Absolutely. Now all the corpses that litter that battlefield can just lie there safe under the knowledge that they snuffed it under a flag of peace and can now happily decompose in a land of freedom. Ya smeg head."
4,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"There really is no pleasing some people, is there?"
4,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Well, at least we got the matter paddle back."
4,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well, there's nothing to stay here for. Let's get back."
4,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Shouldn't we go out onto the battlefield and bask in the glow of victory?"
4,6,LISTER,0.666667,"Holly? Give me his light bee. See ya, Rimmer."
4,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Sir! What are you thinking of?"
4,6,LISTER,0.333333,"It's OK. He'll come out in a couple a days and he'll have been through what he put us through. Does any one fancy a vindaloo?"
5,1,KRYTEN,0.250000,"Wasn't that just beautiful? Oh! Well recommended, sir. D'you think they ever get back together again?"
5,1,LISTER,0.000000,"I don't know."
5,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Pardon?"
5,1,LISTER,0.000000,"I don't know."
5,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Wasn't it just wonderful though, sir? The way he sacrificed his career, his dreams, everything for the woman he loved."
5,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I thought it was the worst pile of blubbery school-girl mush I've ever been compelled to endure. I consider it an insult to my backside I was forced to sit here growing carbuncles through such putrid adolescent slush."
5,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"You didn't find it uplifting?"
5,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"It wasn't in the least bit uplifting. It was totally unbelievable. Why would he give everything up for a woman he's never going to see again?"
5,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Because she loved him, and he would have that forever.  Isn't that right, sir?"
5,1,CAT,-0.333333,"Personally, I thought it started well but fell apart. All that stuff with the ducks all getting into trouble -- that was great. Then it all went black and white and I fell asleep."
5,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"But sir, that was the cartoon before the main programme!"
5,1,HOLLY,-0.500000,"Hang on chaps, we've got a blip. Quadrant 4, sector 492."
5,1,KRYTEN,1.000000,"I'm on to it right away, Holly."
5,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Those kind of films really irritate me. Just not realistic. There isn't a man in the universe who wouldn't have taken the job and to hell with the woman. Total baloney."
5,1,LISTER,1.000000,"Rimmer, you said that about "King of Kings -- the story of Jesus!""
5,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Well, it's true! A simple carpenter's son who learns how to do magic tricks like that and doesn't go into show-business? Do any of us believe that, even for a second?"
5,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"He was supposed to be the Son of God."
5,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"And when he was carrying that cross up the hill, any normal realistic bloke would have mule-kicked the guy on the left, clobbered the one on the right, and been over that green hill and far away before you could say "Pontius Pilate.""
5,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Why do I feel that somehow you've missed the point? I mean, whether you believe that stuff or not, it's about a dude who sacrifices his life for love."
5,1,RIMMER,0.500000,"Not realistic. As if!"
5,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"You've got no soul, man. No soul."
5,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Sirs, I think you should take a look at this."
5,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Another vessel?"
5,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Too small.  May be a missile."
5,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Impact in 37 seconds."
5,1,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Plotting random evasion course."
5,1,CAT,-0.666667,"What? Am I the only sane one here? Why don't we drop the defensive shields?"
5,1,KRYTEN,0.333333,"A superlative suggestion, sir, with just two minor flaws. One, we don't have any defensive shields, and two, we don't have any defensive shields. Now I realise that, technically speaking, that's only one flaw but I thought it was such a big one it was worth mentioning twice."
5,1,CAT,1.000000,"Good point; well made."
5,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Rimmer, what are you doing?"
5,1,RIMMER,1.500000,"It's incredible! It's beautiful!"
5,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"It's not registering on any scale -- mass, velocity, molecular structure -- all the readings are zero!"
5,1,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Sir, I'm picking up some kind of energy emission."
5,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"They've taken Mr. Rimmer.  Sir! They've taken Mr. Rimmer!"
5,1,CAT,-1.000000,"Quick, let's get out of here before they bring him back!"
5,1,RIMMER,1.000000,"You touched me. I can touch."
5,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"How is this possible?"
5,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"You're all holograms, even the ship?"
5,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Salut."
5,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"How big's the crew?"
5,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Hmmm, what a ship!"
5,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Sports and what?"
5,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Nnno."
5,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Well... we go for runs. Watch gardening programmes on the ship's vid."
5,1,RIMMER,-2.000000,"Well it's got worse these last ten years or so, I can't deny it."
5,1,RIMMER,0.500000,"Twice a day? That's more than some people manage in a lifetime!"
5,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"I mean sad, lonely people. But what happens if you don't have a partner?"
5,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Well I mean some people -- sad, lonely people -- find that that people just aren't attracted to them in that kind of way."
5,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Well! People have always complemented me on my good manners. What a ship!"
5,1,RIMMER,1.000000,"I knew it!"
5,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"But what about love? Surely people still fall in love?"
5,1,KRYTEN,0.500000,"Poor Mr. Rimmer. I fear he is in great danger."
5,1,HOLLY,-1.000000,"I'm trying to get them to handshake, but they're not responding on any frequency."
5,1,CAT,-1.000000,"Well, I say let's break out the laser cannons and give 'em both barrels."
5,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"An adroit suggestion sir, with just two minor drawbacks."
5,1,CAT,0.000000,"OK, forget it!"
5,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"There's nothing to shoot at -- look at the readouts: zero mass."
5,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Of course, a holoship!"
5,1,LISTER,0.000000,"A holoship?"
5,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"The project was in its initial phase when I left the solar system. Ships of no mass or volume able to travel as super-light particles -- tachyons -- through worm-holes and star gates crewed by holograms of great genius and bravery."
5,1,LISTER,0.500000,"And they've taken Rimmer?  He should fit in just perfectly!"
5,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Now I understand why they didn't bother with a handshake. Holo- crews are legendarily arrogant. They despise stupidity wherever they see it, and they see it everywhere."
5,1,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Hang on, I'm getting another energy emission."
5,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"Lister to Red Dwarf. We have in our midst a complete smeg pot. Brains in the anal region. Chin absent -- presumed missing. Genitalia small and inoffensive. Of no value or interest."
5,1,LISTER,-0.750000,"Lister to Red Dwarf. Displays evidence of spoiling for a rumble. Seems unable to grasp simple threats. With careful pummelling, could possibly be sucking tomorrow's lunch through a straw."
5,1,LISTER,-0.666667,"Lister to Red Dwarf. The intruder seems to be blissfully unaware that we have a rather sturdy holowhip in the munitions cabinet. Unless he wants his derriere minced like burger meat, he'd better be history in two seconds flat!"
5,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Second technician Arnold Rimmer, IQ unknown. Captain, this is a magnificent ship."
5,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Which is why, Captain, I feel I could really belong here."
5,1,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Everything I want in my life is here on this ship. I want to join you."
5,1,RIMMER,-0.800000,"Captain, I've been in effective command of Red Dwarf now for nearly four years. I've guided that ragamuffin, ragtail crew of whacked out crazies and hippy peace-niks through hell and back. If I gave the order those guys would crawl on their bellies across broken glass with their flies unzipped. So don't tell me I'm not an officer, Captain, just because in deep space there's no academy around to award me my pips. You've got to take me."
5,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Oh."
5,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Ah."
5,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Who will be my opponent?"
5,1,RIMMER,1.000000,"Well, thank you, commander, for a most fascinating afternoon. It's been most ... fascinating."
5,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"That was just unbelievable!"
5,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Was it OK?"
5,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Different?"
5,1,RIMMER,1.000000,"Erm, look, Nirvanah--"
5,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Look, Nirvanah, what I'm trying to say is--"
5,1,RIMMER,-0.666667,"I hope you didn't get me wrong just then. That meant nothing to me. Truly less than nothing really."
5,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"We may as well have been playing tennis."
5,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I, er, don't suppose you'd fancy a tie-break?"
5,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Nyet problemski."
5,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"What do you talk about?"
5,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I'm sorry. I must have seemed very ignorant. I hardly said anything apart from, "geronimo.""
5,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Dress!"
5,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"What you're suggesting is immoral and illegal. Mind patching is outlawed."
5,1,RIMMER,1.000000,"But it is possible."
5,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Possible but highly dangerous. The side effects can be devastating. You could be reduced to a gibbering simpleton."
5,1,CAT,0.000000,"Reduced?"
5,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"I don't care. I'm prepared to take the chance."
5,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Even if it costs you your mind?"
5,1,CAT,1.000000,"It's a small price to pay."
5,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Look, on that ship I can touch, I can feel, I can taste. I'm not a half man any more. With them I'm whole again."
5,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Rimmer, they're a bunch of arrogant, pompous, emotionally-weird, stuck-up megalomaniacs. Do you really think you're going to fit in with them?  What am I saying? Bon voyage!"
5,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"He's right, sir. Why do you want to throw in with people like that?"
5,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Because I want to be somebody. I want to have a position of authority on a scout ship exploring uncharted space. Work alongside educated men and women. Officers, people who count. Lister, this is my one chance to seize my dream. To be with the winners. Look at me. What do you see?"
5,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Tell me."
5,1,RIMMER,-0.333333,"You see a sad and lonely guy. A guy who left home at sixteen to become an officer and a gentleman, and ended up as a chicken soup machine operative. Is it any wonder my father had four strokes? Is it any wonder he used to sit by the window and dribble? I did that to him. Me!"
5,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"Look, there's nothing wrong with what you did. It was just a job."
5,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"You are your job."
5,1,KRYTEN,-0.250000,"Oh, not so, sir. Now was Albert {Camou} a goal keeper or a philosopher? Was Albert Einstein a clerk in a patent office or the greatest physicist who ever lived? And of course there's the oft told tale of the simple carpenter's son who went on to own the largest chain of pizza stores in history, Harry {Biedelbau}."
5,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Kryten, Albert Einstein didn't spend the best years of his life picking out lumps of dessicated poultry from the end of his nozzle cleaner."
5,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"That doesn't make you a failure."
5,1,RIMMER,0.500000,"It does in my parents' eyes. It does in my brother's eyes. It does in the eyes of everyone with eyes. That's exactly what it makes me."
5,1,KRYTEN,-0.400000,"Sir, I beg you to reconsider. If not for your sanity, you haven't even considered the moral implications of your decision. You will be joining a society where you will be compelled to have sex with beautiful, brilliant women twice daily, on demand. Now, am I really the only one here who finds that just a little bit tacky?  Well, quite clearly I am!"
5,1,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Sir, I've uploaded the two candidates to be inserted into your mind, science officer Buchan -- excellent scientific background, one hundred and sixty nine IQ -- and flight coordinator McQueen -- superlative mathematician, one hundred and seventy two IQ. Now, even taking into account the enormous drag-factor of your own mind, I still think we'll come up with something pretty special."
5,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"But I will still have control?"
5,1,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"You will have access to their knowledge, but your personality will have the power of veto. But sir, I implore you to reconsider. If not for yourself, then for the poor officer whose life you will take."
5,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Wasn't it St. Francis of Assisi himself who said, "Never give a sucker an even break?""
5,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well if he did, sir, it was strictly off the record."
5,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Come on Kryten, get on with it."
5,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Commencing integration."
5,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Glory or insanity awaits."
5,1,LISTER,0.000000,"He's read every book in the medical library?"
5,1,KRYTEN,0.500000,"In under three hours. The change is quite astonishing. But sir, I feel I should warn you: this is not the pile of human wreckage we know as Arnold Rimmer. Prepare yourself."
5,1,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Sir, we've received the co-ordinates. Perhaps we should be, ahem, making tracks?"
5,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Kryten."
5,1,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Just thinking. Assuming of course we're not dealing with five- dimensional objects in a basic Euclidean geometric universe and given the essential premise that all geo-mathematics is based on the hideously limiting notion that one plus one equals two, and not as {Astemeyer} correctly postulates that one and two are in fact the same thing observed from different precepts, the theoretical shape described by {Siddus} must therefore be a poly-dri-doc-deca-wee-hedron-a-hexa-sexa-hedro-adicon-a-di-bi- dolly-he-deca-dodron.  Everything else is popycock. Isn't that so?"
5,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Rimmer?"
5,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I wrote a palindromic haiku this morning -- perhaps you'd like to hear it."
5,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I'm afraid we don't speak Japanese, sir."
5,1,RIMMER,1.000000,"I could translate it into mandarin for you."
5,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Rimmer, we don't speak Japanese, we don't speak mandarin, and we don't speak satsuma!"
5,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"He is really beginning to get on my pecks."
5,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"You must remember, sir, that he's operating on a completely different level to us now. To him we are the intellectual equivalent of domestic science teachers."
5,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Subject ready for transfer."
5,1,RIMMER,0.500000,"Farewell gentlemen. Glory awaits!"
5,1,RIMMER,1.000000,"I shall undertake both tasks simultaneously if it's all the same to you."
5,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Nevertheless, I shall attempt it."
5,1,LISTER,0.500000,"Erm, well you sound exactly like what we're looking for. Are there any questions that you'd like to ask us?"
5,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well we don't do that much salvaging."
5,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Well, we don't eat curry every night if that's what you think. In fact I remember quite clearly last June: Mr. Lister had a pizza. You remember?"
5,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah."
5,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"And you didn't like it. But then I poured curry sauce all over it and he just yummed it up!"
5,1,LISTER,0.000000,"It depends on how drunk we are."
5,1,CAT,0.000000,"Or how much curry he's had."
5,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"F-fine by us -- as long as we can have a curry afterwards, we're cool. But of course, there's one or two other people that we have to see, but in theory if we offered you the post of replacement hologram would you accept?"
5,1,LISTER,0.000000,"No."
5,1,CAT,0.000000,"But you're dead!"
5,1,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Well, thank you very much, Ms. Harrison. Thank you. Thank you very much."
5,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Next!"
5,1,HOLLY,0.000000,"Next candidate:  Deck sergeant Sam Murray."
5,1,LISTER,0.500000,"Ah, Sam. Now, as Holly will have told you--"
5,1,RIMMER,1.000000,"Kryten, my own mind's come back -- you've got to help me."
5,1,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Well, what happened exactly? Was it a slow deterioration in your own intelligence or did it happen in seconds?"
5,1,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Seconds. I'm in the middle of the assessment. You've got to give me another mind patch pronto."
5,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Oh, I'm sorry sir, it's classic rejection syndrome. Once the minds are unmeshed there is nothing we can do."
5,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"What are you talking about?"
5,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well you just don't have the sort of brain that can accept an implant, sir."
5,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"No!"
5,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I'm sorry sir."
5,1,RIMMER,1.000000,"There must be something you can do!"
5,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I'm afraid not."
5,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"But I'm winning, I'm so close!  Who's this? I'm not even gone and you're choosing my replacement!"
5,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"We thought you weren't coming back."
5,1,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Well, you should have known better, shouldn't you? You actually expect something to go right for me? Arnold schmucko Rimmer? Tosspot by royal appointment?"
5,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well, where are you going, sir?"
5,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I'm going to withdraw."
5,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"HmmMMmmmMMMm."
5,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I'm sorry, I'm busy Wednesday. I'm killing myself."
5,1,RIMMER,-0.500000,"To hell and back. I've withdrawn from the challenge."
5,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"I was using a mind patch."
5,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"I would have done anything to get on this ship. Every time I look in the mirror, I see this.  Only to me it doesn't mean hologram, it means half-wit, hopeless, hideous failure. This was a chance to be somebody. Somebody I liked."
5,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Everyone says that."
5,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I cheated."
5,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"You really think?"
5,1,RIMMER,1.000000,"I won."
5,1,LISTER,0.000000,"What?"
5,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"My opponent withdrew. I won. I'm an officer. I leave tonight."
5,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Look, I'm not much good at big speeches, and I know I haven't always been an easy guy to get on with. And I know that, given the choice, I probably wouldn't have chosen you as friends. But, I just want to say ... that over the years, ... I have come to regard you ... as ... people ... I met. I'd just better go, OK?"
5,1,LISTER,1.000000,"See you smeghead."
5,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Transfer."
5,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Transfer."
5,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"There must be some mistake -- these are commander Crane's quarters."
5,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Navigation officer Rimmer reporting, sir."
5,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Permission to speak, sir. I wish to resign my commission, sir."
5,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Flight commander Crane has taken leave of her senses and fallen in love with me, sir."
5,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"That's why she withdrew from the challenge and allowed me to win, sir."
5,1,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Am I? Yes sir, I suppose I am, sir."
5,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Perhaps you'd be kind enough to pass this note on to her, sir."
5,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Permission to return to Red Dwarf, sir."
5,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Oh and sir, you're wrong. We won't be apart, we just ... won't be together."
5,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I cannot believe I just said that!"
5,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Coffee, sir. Double caffineated, quadruple sugar."
5,2,LISTER,1.000000,"Nice one."
5,2,KRYTEN,0.500000,"Ah, Virgil's Aeneid. Oh, the epic tale of Agamemnon's pursuit of Helen of Troy -- the most classic work by the greatest Latin poet who ever put quill to parchment!"
5,2,LISTER,1.000000,"Yeah, it's the comic book version. It's good though, man. Absolutely full of history."
5,2,KRYTEN,-1.333333,"Zap, pow, kersplat, die in bed you Trojan pig-dog, gnyarrg, kerpow. I see they've remained faithful to the original text. I'm sure Virgil would have approved."
5,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Kryten, don't discourage him. It's the only thing he's ever read that doesn't have lift-up flaps."
5,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"I dunno though. This wooden horse of Troy malarkey, I'm not buyin' that."
5,2,RIMMER,1.000000,"It's one of the most famous military maneuvers in history!"
5,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"I mean, the Greeks have been camped outside Troy, kerpowing, zapping, and kersplatting the Trojans for the best part of a decade, yeah?"
5,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"So?"
5,2,LISTER,-0.625000,"So all of a sudden they wake up one mornin' and the Greeks have gone. And there outside the city walls they've left this gift; this tribute to their valiant foes: a huge wooden horse, just large enough to happily contain 500 Greeks in full battle dress and still leave adequate room for toilet facilities? Are you telling me not one Trojan goes, "Hang on a minute, that's a bit of a funny prezzy. What's wrong with a couple hundred pairs of socks and some aftershave?" No, they don't -- they just wheel it in and all decide to go for an early night! People that stupid deserve to be kerpowed, zapped and kersplatted in their beds! You know what the big joke is? From this particular phase in history we derive the phrase, "Beware of Greeks bearing gifts," when it would be much more logical to derive the phrase, "Beware of Trojans, they're complete smegheads!""
5,2,RIMMER,1.000000,"Well, thank you, A.J.P. Taylor."
5,2,CAT,0.000000,"What was that?!"
5,2,HOLLY,0.000000,"Strange, we've changed course."
5,2,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Are you sure, Holly? There's no course change programmed."
5,2,HOLLY,-0.333333,"And again! Mark one eight zero -- a complete turn! We're heading back to Red Dwarf."
5,2,LISTER,1.000000,"Gimme manual, Hol."
5,2,HOLLY,0.000000,"We're locked out!"
5,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"This is not a malfunction, there's something controlling the craft!"
5,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Holly, any traffic around?"
5,2,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Nothing on the local scan."
5,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"This isn't possible, there must be--"
5,2,CAT,0.000000,"What happened to him, his voice finally break?"
5,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Who are you?"
5,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"The Inquisitor!"
5,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Are you okay, sir?"
5,2,LISTER,-0.333333,"Yeah. God, I think so.  A little bit shaky."
5,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I think we should run you through the Mediscan, though, just as a precaution."
5,2,LISTER,1.000000,"Yeah, okay."
5,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"So, Kryten, you've heard of this "Inquisitor?""
5,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Only as a myth; a dark fable; a horror tale, told across the flickering embers of a midnight fire, wherever hardened space dogs gather to drink fermented vegetable products and compete in tales of blood-chilling terror!!"
5,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"A simple "yes" would have sufficed."
5,2,HOLLY,0.000000,"So who is he?"
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah, what's his beef?"
5,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well, the legend tells of a droid -- a self-repairing simulant, who survives till the end of eternity; to the end of time itself. After millions of years alone, he finally reaches the conclusion that there is no god, no afterlife, and the only purpose of existence is to lead a worthwhile life. And so the 'droid constructs a time machine, and roams eternity, visiting every single soul in history, and assessing each one. He erases all those who have wasted their lives and replaces them with those who never had a chance of life -- the unfertilized eggs, the sperms that never made it. THAT is the Inquisitor -- he prunes away the wastrels, expunges the wretched, and deletes the worthless!"
5,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"We're in big trouble."
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Wait a minute! Who's to say what's worthless?"
5,2,CAT,0.666667,"Oh please! Take a look in the mirror! Read your entry in "Who's Nobody!""
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"No, I mean it! Who's to judge? Who's to say what's worthwhile?"
5,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Well, let's face it, Listy, lying on your bunk, reading "What Bike?" and eating sugar puff sandwiches for eight hours every day is unlikely to qualify."
5,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"So just because I haven't writ any symphonies or painted the Sistine Chapel, that makes me prunable?"
5,2,HOLLY,0.000000,"No, being a totally worthless, unwashed space bum, that's what makes you prunable."
5,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Precisely. The criterion is not fame, it is simply to have lived a worthwhile life."
5,2,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Why did no one mention this before? If I had been told this at the start, that the object was to lead a worthwhile life, I could have done something about it! All those charity telethons when I used to ring in and pledge donations -- if I had known this, I would have given them my credit card number!"
5,2,KRYTEN,0.500000,"Sir! Sir, you don't have to be a great philanthropist, or a missionary worker, you simply have to seize the gift of life!"
5,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Oh god."
5,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Make a contribution!"
5,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Oh god."
5,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"No matter how small!"
5,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Oh god."
5,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"You simply have to have lead a life that wasn't totally egocentric, vain and self-serving!"
5,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"You're doing this on purpose, aren't you!"
5,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I'm just trying to make you feel better, sir!"
5,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Well shut up then!"
5,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Hang on a minute, why should we have to take any notice of some half-crazed rogue robot who's appointed himself judge and jury to the whole of humanity? Why should we kowtow to his judgment?"
5,2,LISTER,1.000000,"Good answer, man, good answer!"
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"So where is he?"
5,2,CAT,-1.000000,"I hate these either-or questions."
5,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Pardon?"
5,2,RIMMER,1.000000,"Well, I say this with the highest respect, but what gives you the right to ask -- no, actually -- demand that answer of me, Your Magnificence?"
5,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"But how do I know I'll get a fair hearing?"
5,2,RIMMER,1.000000,"Oh smeg!"
5,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Everyone is judged by their own self?"
5,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Well, first I--"
5,2,RIMMER,1.000000,"I've done good things."
5,2,RIMMER,1.000000,"In my heart, I've always tried to do good things."
5,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Look, in my way, I've tried to lead a good life."
5,2,RIMMER,0.200000,"Ah! What's that in the corner? It's the archangel Gabriel! Well, that's me converted, I'm a new man! Hallelujah!"
5,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Well... sort of, yes."
5,2,RIMMER,-0.285714,"What else could I have been? My father was a half-crazed military failure, my mother was a bitch-queen from hell. My brothers had all the looks and talent. What did I have? Unmanageable hair and ingrowing toenails. Yes, I admit I'm nothing. But from what I started with, nothing is up."
5,2,CAT,1.000000,"Hi, buddy!"
5,2,CAT,1.000000,"I'm hearing you on FM!"
5,2,CAT,2.000000,"I have given pleasure to the world because I have such a beautiful ass!"
5,2,CAT,0.000000,"Can I go now?"
5,2,CAT,0.000000,"You need more?"
5,2,CAT,-0.500000,"Some might say I'm a pretty shallow guy. But a shallow guy with a great ass!"
5,2,CAT,1.000000,"Thank you!"
5,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I'm not sure I can."
5,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"But I am programmed to live unselfishly. And therefore, any good works I do come not out of fine motives but as a result of a series of binary commands I am compelled to obey."
5,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Perhaps only if he attempted to break his programming and conduct his life according to a set of values he arrived at independently."
5,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"The rules are yours, not mine."
5,2,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Well, I am programmed not to wish for anything. I serve."
5,2,KRYTEN,-0.666667,"But I am not human, and neither are you. And it is not our place to judge them. I wonder why you do?"
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"What're you talkin' about?"
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"So?"
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"So?"
5,2,LISTER,1.000000,"Spin on it!"
5,2,LISTER,0.500000,"You scum! You've wiped them out!"
5,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Sir!"
5,2,LISTER,1.000000,"He's crazy, Kryten! He's erased the Cat and Rimmer!"
5,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Sir... I'm afraid it is we who are to be erased."
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Ah."
5,2,LISTER,1.000000,"The Cat has lead a more worthwhile life than either of us?"
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"What's this?"
5,2,KRYTEN,0.333333,"Best guess: we are being surgically removed from time. Every memory of us, every action we ever performed is being dissolved. Our lives are being undone."
5,2,LISTER,1.000000,"Well, if you've got some amazing secret plan up your sleeve, Kryten, now's the time to mention it."
5,2,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"No plan, sir.  No sleeves."
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"What the smeg is goin' on?"
5,2,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"What about me? I mean... you... I mean... us?"
5,2,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Killed? How?"
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"How? Can you give us a clue?"
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,""Enig?!""
5,2,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Come on sir, we have to go!"
5,2,LISTER,1.000000,"He's just killed you, Kryten!"
5,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Sir! We have to go!"
5,2,HOLLY,-0.500000,"You are not registered as personnel of this vessel. Please state your name and clearance code."
5,2,LISTER,1.000000,"It's us, Hol!!"
5,2,HOLLY,0.000000,"Please state your name and clearance code."
5,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Lister, D. Treble zero, one six nine."
5,2,HOLLY,-1.000000,"I have no record of your palm-print."
5,2,HOLLY,0.000000,"Intruder Alert! Intruder Alert!"
5,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Initiating Override!"
5,2,HOLLY,0.000000,"Please state your name and clearance code."
5,2,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Logon name: Kryten. Registration code: Additional zero zero one."
5,2,HOLLY,-1.000000,"I have no record of your CPU ident."
5,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"We don't exist here anymore!"
5,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Tear gas!"
5,2,LISTER,1.000000,"Oh, thank god it's you guys."
5,2,CAT,1.000000,"Move so much as an eyebrow, and you're dogmeat."
5,2,LISTER,0.500000,"What? It's us!"
5,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Who are you people and what do you want?"
5,2,LISTER,0.500000,"Rimmer! It's me!"
5,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"How do you know my name?"
5,2,CAT,-1.000000,"Don't fall for that one, buddy, he read it on your uniform!"
5,2,KRYTEN,-0.666667,"Sir, they've never met us before. We are limbo people, between realities. They have no memory of us."
5,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"So, I'm going to ask you one more time: what do you want?"
5,2,LISTER,-0.666667,"Yo, we're not the enemy! There's a guy 'round 'ere somewhere, wanderin' 'round obliteratin' people from history! We used to be your shipmates."
5,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Only we've forgotten you."
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah!"
5,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Well, I don't know about you, but I'm convinced."
5,2,LISTER,1.000000,"Rimmer, I know you!"
5,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Well, if you do know me, you'll know I'm the kind of rough-and- tumble, hardened Astro, ex-Marine type guy you do not trifle with."
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"No, you're not!"
5,2,RIMMER,1.000000,"For the last time, I'm asking--"
5,2,LISTER,0.400000,"Fiona Barringson! Fifteen years of age. You got off with her in your Dad's greenhouse. You thought you got lucky but it turned out all the time that you had your hand in warm compost. How could I know that, and not know you?"
5,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Not true!"
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"You got three brothers: John, Howard, and Frank. You're really mean with money. You're a tremendous physical coward. You once spent an afternoon on the Samaritan switchboard, and four people committed suicide! Your middle name's Judas, but you tell everyone that it's Jonathan. You sign all your official letters A.J. Rimmer, B.S.C., and B.S.C. stands for Bronze Swimming Certificate. You're a cheating, weaselly, lowlife scumbucket, with all the charm and social grace of a pubic louse!"
5,2,CAT,-1.000000,"Gotta admit, bud, he's got a handle on ya there."
5,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Sirs, you've got to help us! The Inquisitor will stop at nothing to obliterate us!"
5,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"Never mind, "Who the smeg are these guys?" Who the smeg are you?"
5,2,KRYTEN,0.666667,"Of course! He's the alternative you! One of the many David Listers who never got a chance to exist."
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"So we're kind of... sperms-in-law?"
5,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Yes, sir."
5,2,CAT,0.000000,"So whatta we do with 'em?"
5,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I say waste them."
5,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"You're tellin' me?!"
5,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Look, they come here with some cock-and-bull story, they're chained together like Sidney Poiter and Tony Curtis -- I say open the door to oblivion and kick 'em through."
5,2,LISTER,1.000000,"Yeah, right!"
5,2,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Look, they're from some freaky alternative dimension, they've come here to hijack this ship and do... oooh, weird things to us. I think we should take the lift, put them on the security deck and stick them in the brig."
5,2,CAT,1.000000,"I hate to say it, but for once TransAm-wheel-arch-nostrils is right. Come on, get moving!"
5,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"What did you call me?"
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Look man, you know the score."
5,2,LISTER,-0.333333,"Because you're me. We're shot from the same gun-barrel. Only difference is, one did breast-stroke, one did crawl."
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"I'm saying--"
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"That's him, guys!"
5,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"C'mon, let's go."
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Let's go back! Let's go back!"
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Oh my god. Hang on a minute, I can use this. C'mon, go!"
5,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"If we got down to the transport decks, maybe we could nick one of the Starbugs, and get outta town."
5,2,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Uh-oh, a door. We'd better use an air vent."
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"No need."
5,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Sir?"
5,2,LISTER,-0.666667,"Look, I'm gonna do something now, Kryten, that's totally, totally gross. I don't want you to look. Turn around."
5,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"What?"
5,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Trust me, you don't wanna know!"
5,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Logically, sir, there is only one way you could have possibly have opened that door. I feel quite nauseous. Where is it?"
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Where's what?"
5,2,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Oh, sir!! You've got it in your jacket!!"
5,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"I got us out of the hold, didn't I?"
5,2,KRYTEN,-0.666667,"Sir, you are sick! You are a sick, sick person! How can you possibly even conceive of such an idea?"
5,2,LISTER,0.500000,"Cheer up! Or I'll beat you to death with the wet end!"
5,2,KRYTEN,-0.250000,"Sir, if mechanoids could barf, I'd be onto my fifth bag by now. You're a sick person! Sick! Sick!"
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"C'mon, Kryten, let's go! C'mon!"
5,2,LISTER,-0.666667,"What's the point? Why am I tryin' to get outta this? We already know we fail."
5,2,KRYTEN,-0.750000,"Not so, sir! All we know is that I die. Now, if my small gambit ultimately results in your safety, then it will be a move well made. For myself, death holds no fear."
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Oh yeah?"
5,2,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"Sir, I am programmed to relinquish my life. That's why the Mechanoid 4000 series was voted "Android of the Year" five years running! I have as much interest in saving my own life as a chronically-depressed lemming."
5,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"That's not true, is it?"
5,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Sir?"
5,2,LISTER,-0.125000,"Not anymore. And it's all because of me. It's my fault. 'Cause I made ya break your programmin'. I taught ya how to lie. How to make your own decisions. I made you more... more human. I gave you a life to lose."
5,2,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Sir, with the greatest respect, that is complete and utter shash."
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Kryten, I know when you're lying. Your right foot jiggles. It's involuntary."
5,2,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"Nonsense.  I'm not afraid to die.  For me, death holds no fear.  I believe in Silicon Heaven! I believe in an afterlife for androids! Haven't you got through those damn manacles yet!?"
5,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"Kryten!! I'm not gonna let it happen, man."
5,2,KRYTEN,-0.250000,"Cause and effect, sir. It already has happened. There's nothing we can do except to try and save your life.  Okay, now I think I have this, it's a variant of the Enigma decoding system."
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Enigma! Enig -- Enigma!"
5,2,KRYTEN,-0.333333,""Enig," of course! My last words! Well, anyway, if this thing works, it should age those manacles by half a million years."
5,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"If it doesn't work?"
5,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"It'll wipe out the universe."
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Phew. What now?"
5,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Well now, we have the power."
5,2,CAT,-1.000000,"Okay, we don't know who you are, but we've seen enough of the other dude to know we wanna be on your side."
5,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"He killed our two crew-mates in cold blood, he's a monster."
5,2,CAT,-1.000000,"I'm the Cat, this is Rimmer."
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah.  Lister. Kryten."
5,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Look, I want to make it clear, I'm not exactly in love with the idea of pitching in with you two, but needs must as the devil drives."
5,2,LISTER,-0.666667,"You really don't remember me, do ya? Everything I did used to get on your pecks. How I used to be trimmin' me toenails with your electric meat-carver or something, and you'd go absolutely spare."
5,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Sir, we really must get down to the storage bay. Now remember my message to us -- that is where we meet the Inquisitor for the final confrontation."
5,2,CAT,0.250000,"That's your plan? We go out there and face him? Nice plan. Shall I paint a bullseye on my face?"
5,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Listen, Kryten, I've been thinkin' about this, I've come up with somethin'."
5,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Yes, sir?"
5,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"I'm gonna use my brains for the first time in my life."
5,2,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Considering the circumstances, sir, do you really believe that's wise?"
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Gimme the time gauntlet."
5,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"But you don't know how to use it, sir!"
5,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"You'll have to shout out instructions, won't ya?"
5,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Wouldn't it be simpler if I wore it?"
5,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"You can't wear it, Kryten!"
5,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Why not?"
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"You're programmed not to kill."
5,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Kryten, I don't know how to work this thing."
5,2,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Gamma, delta, one four five."
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Smeg! You youthed me!"
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Now what the smeg have ya done to me?"
5,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Excuse me, could I just distract you for a brief second?"
5,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Excuse me, could I possibly just distract you for just a brief second?"
5,2,KRYTEN,1.000000,"It was the best I could ad-lib at the time."
5,2,LISTER,1.000000,"He got the Cat and Rimmer, though."
5,2,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"I know. Look sir, I've got to go back in time and sacrifice myself in order that we can get into this mess we're in now in the first place."
5,2,LISTER,1.000000,"Yeah, sure."
5,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"All in all, today's been a bit of a bummer, hasn't it, sir?"
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"How long before he unfreezes? Ten minutes?"
5,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"No. Eight point four."
5,2,LISTER,1.000000,"We'd better be right, Kryten."
5,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I know. Gauntlets."
5,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Now what do I say when I pop up behind the Inquisitor?"
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Uh... "Perfect, now what do I--""
5,2,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"That's it, that's it. Don't tell me -- I've got it. Don't tell me -- I've got it, I've got it."
5,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"OK, big fella, it's danglin' time."
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Welcome back on-line."
5,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"One way or the other, you killed a lot of my friends this afternoon. In fact, you may never get on my good side again."
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Oops."
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Strong talk for a guy who's dangling over a chasm."
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Oh yeah? Bet your life?"
5,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"I never intended to kill you."
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"No. I intended to save your life."
5,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"'Cos if I save your life, and you erase me, then I won't be there to save your life, and you'll die. Chew on that, pal."
5,2,LISTER,-0.666667,"Well, I'm allright. Ya can't touch me. You might've killed the others, but I'm okay."
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"That's a point."
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah."
5,2,LISTER,-0.333333,"Yeah! It's the old backfiring-time-gauntlet trick. You just bought yourself a one-way ticket to oblivion."
5,2,LISTER,1.000000,"Oh, it worked!"
5,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"It worked?"
5,2,LISTER,1.000000,"Kryten, you're a genius!"
5,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"It was your scheme, sir. I simply re-programmed the gauntlet."
5,2,LISTER,0.000000,"So what happens now?"
5,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well, basically we wait for the time-space continuum to re-order itself."
5,2,KRYTEN,1.000000,"I believe this is an appropriate juncture for you to give me five, sir."
5,2,LISTER,0.666667,"Give you five? I can do better than that!  I can give you fifteen!"
5,3,KRYTEN,0.200000,"Kryten personal blackbox recording. Time: unknown. Location: unknown. Cause of accident: unknown. Should someone find this recording perhaps it will shed light as to what happened here."
5,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Secondly, due to the proximity of the magnetic coils, my short- term memory appears to have been erased. This, combined with the erasure of my short-term memory, has has left me a little disoriented, disoriented, disoriented."
5,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"67 minutes!! I'd better get out of here!"
5,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Of course."
5,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Can you hear me?"
5,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Find an ore sample pod. There should be plenty strewn around the crash site. Initiate the homing procedure and bring help. OK? Good Luck boy. Go on."
5,3,LISTER,0.000000,"OK. I'm here... What's the beef?"
5,3,HOLLY,0.000000,"We've got a visitor."
5,3,LISTER,0.000000,"What?"
5,3,HOLLY,0.000000,"A pod arrived about 20 minutes ago. Something was in it, but it's broken free."
5,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Any ideas?"
5,3,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Well, I don't want to spread any panic or alarm."
5,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Whaddya mean, you don't wanna spread panic and alarm?"
5,3,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Well, you've always had this thing against tarantulas, haven't you?"
5,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Tarantulas?"
5,3,HOLLY,-1.000000,"I mean that you've never been overly fond of them as a species, have you?"
5,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well, no."
5,3,HOLLY,-1.000000,"And the prospect of waking up and finding one crawling over your clammy, naked, helpless body has always filled you with a kind of cold dread?"
5,3,LISTER,0.500000,"Well, yeah. Wotya trying to say to me, Holly?"
5,3,HOLLY,0.333333,"I'm saying it might not be your night. Look at this. This is the best shot the security cameras could get."
5,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Where is it now?"
5,3,HOLLY,-1.000000,"We lost it."
5,3,LISTER,0.000000,"What does Kryten think?"
5,3,HOLLY,0.333333,"Kryten's off moon-hopping with Rimmer. Radio link's down. I'll keep trying."
5,3,CAT,0.000000,"So what's the problem? Hey, you OK? You look tense."
5,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"> HELP > Something is crawling up my leg. I think it's a taranshula"
5,3,CAT,-1.000000,"You're playing that dumb adventure game."
5,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"> It's in my boxers. It's making a nest"
5,3,CAT,0.000000,"Then buy a potion from Gandalf, the master wizard. That's what I usually do."
5,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"> I'm SERIOUS."
5,3,CAT,1.000000,"> It has an eye the size of a meatball"
5,3,LISTER,0.000000,"> Kill it"
5,3,CAT,0.000000,"> How?"
5,3,LISTER,0.333333,"> I can't think straight. I've got a taranshula with an eye the size of a meatball setting up home in my joy department. Help me."
5,3,CAT,0.000000,"> I'm scared"
5,3,LISTER,0.000000,"> YOU'RE scared. How d'you think I feel?"
5,3,CAT,-1.000000,"> You haven't SEEN it!!"
5,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"> The lower half of my body has gone numb."
5,3,CAT,1.000000,"> That's probably for the best."
5,3,LISTER,0.000000,"> It's moving > Oh *#%^**!!!!"
5,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Kryten man, take it easy. I'm gonna getcha out of there."
5,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"My legs, I can't feel them."
5,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Yeah, they're trapped under this stanchion. I'm gonna have to cut you in two."
5,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Begging your pardon, sir?"
5,3,LISTER,-0.200000,"Kryten, man. Keep still. I'm trying to draw a line here. I don't want it to go all wonky. I want as much of you as possible."
5,3,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"Sir, a couple of brief points. Firstly, you are not a qualified service engineer and consequently sawing me in two will invalidate my guarantee. Secondly, I wouldn't trust you to open a can of sardines that was already open."
5,3,CAT,-0.250000,"Oops. You're right. He really isn't dead. I owe you twenty."
5,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Kryten, you OK?"
5,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I think so, sir."
5,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"There's a few bits and bobs left over, but it's always the same when you try a bit of do-it-yourself, isn't it?"
5,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Where's Mr. Rimmer?"
5,3,CAT,-1.000000,"We were just gonna ask you that."
5,3,LISTER,0.000000,"What happened?"
5,3,KRYTEN,-0.750000,"Well, there are gaps. I remember Mr. Rimmer spotted an S3 planet on the scope and wanted to claim it on behalf of the Space Corps. As usual the ceremony consisted of planting the flag and singing all 23 stanzas of the Space Corps Anthem. Then the planet started to erupt around us, which, frankly, came as something of a relief."
5,3,LISTER,0.000000,"A moon quake?"
5,3,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Worse. It was as if the entire planet was reshaping, terraforming itself as we watched."
5,3,LISTER,0.000000,"And then?"
5,3,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Then things got a bit sketchy. I remember an explosion and then blackness. And then I remember Mr. Rimmer screaming. I have an image of his face twisted with fear, pain, anguish, dread -- absolutely mortified."
5,3,CAT,-1.000000,"Did someone suggest he pick up the tab for lunch?"
5,3,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Something took him. Something awful."
5,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Can we track him, Holly? Can you get a trace on his lightbee?"
5,3,HOLLY,0.000000,"Got 'im. Click and a half due south."
5,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Suggest we continue the journey by land, sir. I'll lower the caterpillar tracks."
5,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I think I've just worked out what that missing circuit board is for, sir."
5,3,CAT,-1.000000,"This is one weird place. Strange animal noises, unbearable stench, squelchy underfoot.  It's just like your laundry basket at the end of the month."
5,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Get anything?"
5,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"My guess: this is a Psi-moon."
5,3,CAT,0.000000,"Psi-moon?"
5,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"An artificial planetoid. It tunes into an individual psyche and adapts its terrain to mimic his mental state. In this instance I believe it reconfigured itself using Mr. Rimmer's subconscious as a template."
5,3,LISTER,0.000000,"What are you saying to me, Kryten?"
5,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"We are interlopers inside Mr. Rimmer's mind."
5,3,CAT,0.000000,"This sounds like a 12-change-of-underwear trip."
5,3,LISTER,0.000000,"If this planet's Rimmer's mind, what is it that took him?"
5,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"All his neuroses. All his personal demons will be incarnated here -- made flesh."
5,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Example?"
5,3,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Well, each person's mindscape is unique but we could well encounter, say, Mr. Rimmer's lust personified as some kind of slobbering, rampaging beast."
5,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Rimmer's lust monster?! Urrgh."
5,3,KRYTEN,-0.666667,"Every individual's mental landscape is dominated by one drive. In some cases it might be ambition, in others greed, envy, or the desire to please. Whatever it is that took Mr. Rimmer, we can only pray that its intentions are benign."
5,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"Aw, c'mon, he can't be in that much danger. I mean, he's a hologram."
5,3,KRYTEN,0.500000,"Not here. Here he will have a physical form until he leaves and any danger he may be in will be very real indeed."
5,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Look, I don't know who you are, or what you think you're doing, but I demand my right to a phone call."
5,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Yes, I thought that would stop you. I thought the threat of legal action would have you running for cover."
5,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Look, I'm trying to keep my temper, but you really are pushing your luck now, my laddins."
5,3,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Is this the British Embassy? Does it even look the remotest bit like the British Embassy? I want to know who you are, what I'm doing here, and I want to know now!"
5,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Well that's cleared that one up."
5,3,RIMMER,-0.166667,"Ohhh! Thank God. Thank God. There were some very, very strange men running around in black hoods with drums and rather unconvincing red eyes. Thank God you're here. You know, I actually thought I was in the most awful danger."
5,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Is it me or has it suddenly got rather hot in here?"
5,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"What's happening? Why have we stopped?"
5,3,KRYTEN,-0.666667,"I don't like the look of that swamp, sir. I don't think it will support the 'Bug. I suggest we continue the journey on foot."
5,3,LISTER,0.000000,"You mean go out there?"
5,3,CAT,1.000000,"Out into Rimmer's subconscious?"
5,3,HOLLY,-0.500000,"According to the signal we're almost on top of him. Shouldn't be more than 2 or 3 hundred meters."
5,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Remember, it's Rimmer's mind out there.  Expect sickness."
5,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I'm a second technician in the Space Corps. I'm briefed to give you my name and number and nothing more. I don't know who you are or what you think you're playing at, but I'm not going to give you anything else."
5,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Err, where are you going? Err, what are you doing? My God! Are you going to take a flying leap?"
5,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"The Master?"
5,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"This Master character -- and I acknowledge that I may not want to know the full answer to this one -- but why does he want me oily in particular? Obviously, whatever he has in mind is facilitated by my being slippery and pliant, yes?"
5,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Not the best news, but it could have been worse."
5,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Why I ever agreed to go for a stroll in Rimmer's psyche I will never know."
5,3,CAT,1.000000,"Aw terrific. This gets better and better."
5,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Is it just me or are those frogs saying, "Useless?""
5,3,CAT,0.500000,"Hey look at this! You've got a huge great blood sucking leech on your neck."
5,3,CAT,1.000000,"It's got a human face."
5,3,LISTER,0.000000,"It's Rimmer's mum!"
5,3,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Here, come quickly. I think I've found a metaphor."
5,3,LISTER,0.000000,"A what?"
5,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Look at all these gravestones."
5,3,LISTER,-1.000000,""HERE LIES SELF-RESPECT, DIED AGE 24"."
5,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"They're all aspects of Mr. Rimmer's personality which are dead. "GENEROSITY, DIED AGE NINE." "SELF-CONFIDENCE TAKEN FROM US, AGE TWENTY-TWO.""
5,3,LISTER,-1.000000,""HONOUR, GONE BUT NOT FORGOTTEN, DIED AGE TWELVE.""
5,3,CAT,0.000000,"Look at this. This one's minute."
5,3,LISTER,0.500000,"Check this one. This one's freshly dug."
5,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Who's it for?"
5,3,KRYTEN,-0.666667,"Oh! Psychologically speaking, Mr. Rimmer may be in far bigger trouble than any of us ever suspected. If we don't get to him before this grave is filled, we may never get out of this nightmare."
5,3,RIMMER,-0.750000,"Boy, am I glad to see you. You must be the Unspeakable One. Just to fill you in, there's been a gigantic administrative cockup. Some of your staff have somehow mistaken me for a virgin."
5,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Sorry. Yes, I do tend to jabber on a bit when I'm nervous."
5,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I've never been partial to physical torture. It's actually always been one of my... worst nightmares actually."
5,3,LISTER,1.000000,"He's got to be somewhere near here. We should be right on top of him."
5,3,CAT,0.000000,"Whatever it was, let's hope it's had lunch."
5,3,KRYTEN,1.000000,"It's right below us."
5,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Who are you?"
5,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Here."
5,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"And why are you being so horrible to me?"
5,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"My self-loathing?"
5,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Yes."
5,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"Look, we've got two choices. Either we go in with bazookoids blazing and try and somehow get him out of there or we sit here like lemons and watch him get tortured."
5,3,CAT,0.000000,"Anybody got any opera glasses?"
5,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"Set bazookoids to kill-stuff-and-mount -- we're going in. Kryten?"
5,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Reload!"
5,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"But sir, another barrage of bazookoid fire could start a rockslide and bury us all!"
5,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Reload!"
5,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"You'd risk your lives for me?"
5,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Of course. You're part of the crew."
5,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"What happened?"
5,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Weird."
5,3,CAT,0.000000,"Where'd he go?"
5,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"There's an old android saying which I believe is peculiarly appropriate here."
5,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"In binary language it goes something like this: 001100111011000111100, which roughly translated means, "Don't stand around jabbering when you're in mortal danger.""
5,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Which way?"
5,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well, we go right at the Swamp of Despair, straight past the Wood of Humiliation and then hard left at the Chasm of Hopelessness."
5,3,CAT,0.000000,"You're a weird guy, you know that?"
5,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Why're you all looking at me like that? Like, as if this is all my fault? Have you any idea what kind of day I've had? I've been kidnapped, stripped, oiled, menaced, manacled, licked, nibbled, chained, tortured, humiliated, and I nearly had a knobbly thing the size and shape of a Mexican agabe cactus jammed up where only customs men dare to probe."
5,3,CAT,0.000000,"Don't you know what this place is?"
5,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Yes, it's a hell hole. It's a nightmare. It's a stinking infested pit of putridness."
5,3,LISTER,1.000000,"Rimmer, it's your mind."
5,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"He's right, sir. This is a psi-moon. It's terrain was landscaped by your psyche."
5,3,RIMMER,0.500000,"So... So what are you saying to me? That thing... that, that beast... that lives inside my mind?"
5,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Metaphorically, yes, sir."
5,3,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Self-loathing? I don't loathe myself. What is there one could possibly loathe about me?"
5,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Would you like the list, sir?"
5,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"What list?"
5,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well. There's the fact that you were despised by your parents for failing to achieve their standards; the fact that your three brothers were all such high flyers in the Space Corps and you ended up servicing chicken soup machines; there's your inability to form long term relationships with anyone; your cowardliness; your lack of charm, honour, or grace; and the awful knowledge that throughout your entire life no one has truly liked you because you are so fundamentally unlikeable."
5,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"Oh, that!"
5,3,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Please don't interrupt, sir. I'm only halfway through my list. Now where was I? Oh yes--"
5,3,LISTER,1.000000,"I think he's got the point, Kryten."
5,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"God, I'm such a mess."
5,3,LISTER,0.000000,"What's that?"
5,3,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Trouble. We've hit quicksand. We're being sucked down."
5,3,LISTER,1.000000,"Hit the retros."
5,3,HOLLY,-0.500000,"Can't get any lift, but they're keeping us stable. Ten minutes before they burn out."
5,3,CAT,0.000000,"OK. I say get into the jet-powered rocket pants and junior-birdman the hell out of here."
5,3,KRYTEN,0.500000,"An excellent and inventive suggestion, sir, with just two tiny drawbacks: A. We don't have any jet-powered rocket pants; and B. There's no such thing as jet-powered rocket pants outside the ... outside the fictional serial Robbie Rocket Pants."
5,3,CAT,-1.000000,"Well that's put a crimp an otherwise damn fine plan."
5,3,HOLLY,0.500000,"Hang on. I'm getting a powerful energy emission."
5,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Where are you going?"
5,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Where do you think I'm going? You heard him! If I don't hand myself over he's going to throw everything he's got at Starbug."
5,3,LISTER,0.000000,"What? You're really going to give yourself up?"
5,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"No. I'm going down to the engine room to cower behind one of the boilers. And I suggest you all find ingenious places to tremble behind too."
5,3,HOLLY,-1.000000,"If you want my opinion the only way anyone's to get out of here alive is by working out some way of killing that thing."
5,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"How? Bazookoids were totally ineffective against it. It's invulnerable."
5,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"We're finished."
5,3,HOLLY,0.000000,"Increasing retros to max. Now stable."
5,3,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"Now wait a minute. Hmmm.  This is all your fault, you know, you little glob of terburculatic sputum."
5,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Ah hah! Interesting.  Sir, you are a cruddy little scud ball with all the innate lovability of an itchy veruka."
5,3,KRYTEN,0.500000,"Excellent. Mr. Lister, Cat -- confabulation in the cockpit."
5,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Ah, not you, sir."
5,3,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"Sirs, I think I have it. The real enemy is not out there, it is in Starbug with us. The real enemy is inside Mr. Rimmer's head."
5,3,CAT,0.500000,"Nice plan. So we remove his head and everything's cool, right?"
5,3,LISTER,-0.333333,"No, wait a minute. That's gone right up my flagpole, that has, Kryten. I'm saluting that one."
5,3,CAT,0.000000,"What?"
5,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"When we first drove back the beast in the cavern, it wasn't the bazookoid fire the forced him into the pit. It was when you told Rimmer we wouldn't desert him."
5,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Precisely."
5,3,LISTER,0.000000,"So if we can make Rimmer feel wanted, feel cared about..."
5,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"If we can make him feel good about himself, somehow restore his self-esteem and his pride, that would automatically vanquish the self- loathing beast, or at least debilitate it long enough for us to break free of this quicksand and get off this God forsaken psi-moon."
5,3,CAT,0.000000,"How do we make him feel good? What is there about him to feel good about?"
5,3,LISTER,1.000000,"We've got to tell him we love him."
5,3,CAT,-0.500000,"Arrrrgh, you're sick! I want no part of this depravity!"
5,3,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"He must not suspect we are insincere. Our lives depend on it. Ready?"
5,3,CAT,0.000000,"I'll never be ready."
5,3,LISTER,0.500000,"Listen, we've been talking and the three of us have decided to stay with you and face the danger. All for one and that, you know?"
5,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Really?"
5,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Sir, I'd just like to take this opportunity to say that you are a very beautiful person."
5,3,LISTER,1.000000,"What he means is, that we're all facing certain death here and I think it's about time we let each other know exactly how we feel about each other."
5,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"You think that's a good idea?"
5,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Its just that guys generally aren't terrific at ... you know..."
5,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Expressing their feelings."
5,3,LISTER,-0.666667,"Yeah. They kid around and insult each other and stuff. And what they really mean is... Well, they can't tell you the stuff they really mean."
5,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"What are you trying to tell me?"
5,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Just trying to say that whatever happens here, I want you to know I really care about you."
5,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"We all do, sir."
5,3,CAT,1.000000,"It's true. They really do care about you."
5,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Only this morning you referred to me as a cancerous polyp on the anus of humanity."
5,3,LISTER,1.000000,"In an affectionate way. In a kidding around, joking, friendly, affectionate way."
5,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Sir, what he's trying to say is that we may never get another opportunity to articulate our feelings and I, for one, would just like to take this opportunity to say that you're a splendant man and a much- respected colleague and a -- gosh darn it -- damn good friend."
5,3,HOLLY,-1.000000,"We're getting some lift."
5,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Wait a minute. I know why you're doing this."
5,3,HOLLY,0.000000,"Going down."
5,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"You're trying to make me feel guilty, aren't you? It's a transparent attempt to shame me into doing the honourable thing."
5,3,LISTER,0.000000,"No, it's not that at all."
5,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"What gave you that idea?"
5,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Well, why is it then?"
5,3,LISTER,1.000000,"Our number is up here and I don't want to go out without setting the record straight. It's not easy saying this one man to another, but, I love you, man. I really, really love you."
5,3,HOLLY,0.000000,"Going up."
5,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I think it might be a good idea at this time if we try and get into a kind of a four-way hug situation."
5,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"What's wrong with you?"
5,3,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"I don't think people touch enough, sir. I think people should touch more."
5,3,LISTER,0.666667,"I love you, Arnie. This is a beautiful man. Big Man."
5,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"This is a beautiful moment, isn't it?"
5,3,LISTER,0.500000,"You're a big man. We love you, A.J.!"
5,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"God. Oh..."
5,3,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Quick, get into the cockpit. There's something very strange happening out there."
5,3,HOLLY,-1.000000,"We're getting some lift."
5,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Twenty metres. That's enough for liftoff."
5,3,HOLLY,-1.000000,"We're almost clear."
5,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"It was all baloney, wasn't it?"
5,3,LISTER,0.000000,"What was?"
5,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"All that hugging stuff back there. It was just a way of escaping, wasn't it? I mean you didn't really feel that deep down I'm an OK sort of bloke; I'm not such a bad old stick once you get to know me. You didn't really mean any of that, did you?"
5,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Gravity 1.5. Wind 40 knots and variable. Coordinates locked and set. Launch Scouter."
5,4,RIMMER,-0.666667,"Wait a minute. I'm in charge of security and surveillance on- board this vessel. I, Mr. Kryten, am the one that says, "Launch Scouter.""
5,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I'm sorry sir, I didn't mean to steal your thunder."
5,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Launch Scouter."
5,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Launch Scouter."
5,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I'll be in the stern, correlating the ... in the stern."
5,4,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Would you be so good as to launch the Scouter, please, sir."
5,4,CAT,-1.000000,"Aye Aye, sir!  Scouter Launched, sir."
5,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Sir, it appears we've encountered a scientific research centre."
5,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"And there is someone in there, man -- a survivor."
5,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"A Dr. Hildegard Lanstrom."
5,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Clearly I am superfluous to this entire operation, ably commanded as it is by a droid who was created purely to clean lavatories. So I really don't know why you're telling me all this, Captain Bog-Bot."
5,4,LISTER,1.000000,"She's a hologram."
5,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I'm afraid we are going to have to commandeer your remote projection unit in order to rescue her, sir."
5,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Oh, I see. First of all I am deemed unsuitable to issue the command, "Launch Scouter," and now I am being bundled into an escape pod and relieved of my duties by Commander U-bend."
5,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Rimmer, why are you taking this so personal? It's the only way to get her back to the ship."
5,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Why do we need another hologram on-board?"
5,4,KRYTEN,1.000000,"She's a doctor, sir. She would be a valuable asset to the team."
5,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"And as usual it is left to me to point out the fatal flaw in your logic."
5,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Flaw?"
5,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"This vessel, gentlemen and khazi droids, the crimson short one up there, can only sustain one hologram, or had you forgotten?"
5,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"You hadn't forgotten?"
5,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Look, we could work something out. Some kind of "timeshare" thing."
5,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"What d'you mean? What do you think I am, a holiday villa in the Algarve?"
5,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Sir, might I remind you, as Space Corps directive 169 quite clearly states--"
5,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Holly, prepare an escape pod. Anything to save me from another "Space Corps Directive.""
5,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Sir, the Space Corps directives are there to protect us. They are not a set of vindictive pronouncements directed against any one person."
5,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Has anyone ever seen this legendary Space Corps directive manual?"
5,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well, no."
5,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"He's making it up, isn't he? The bloody book doesn't exist."
5,4,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Sir, I assure you--"
5,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Why does he only ever use them against me? Why never against Lister? Why do we never hear him quoting a Space Corps directive that clearly states, "No crew-member should floss his teeth with the E- string of his guitar after spraying the entire contents of his sugar puff sandwich all over his superior's bunk?" We never hear that one, do we?"
5,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Holly, kindly furnish Mr. Rimmer with a hologrammatic copy of the Space Corps directive manual."
5,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Come on, where is it?"
5,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"That's it?"
5,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"You should be able to study it at your leisure on your trip back to Red Dwarf, sir."
5,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"You've changed, you know that?"
5,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Changed?"
5,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"They may not see it, but I do. I know what's going on, you've become a really nasty piece of work."
5,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"But sir, I was merely--"
5,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"You're merely a mechanoid -- that's all you're "merely." Don't ever forget it."
5,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"What a smee... What a smee... What a smee Heeeeeeee."
5,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Dr. Lanstrom!"
5,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Are you there Doctor?"
5,4,LISTER,1.000000,"Oh brutal!"
5,4,CAT,0.000000,"Huh?!"
5,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"There is no need for alarm, sir. If there were any dangerous viral strains in the atmosphere, the Psi-scan would have picked them up by now."
5,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Hmmm, it's never done that before."
5,4,KRYTEN,-2.000000,"Blasted stupid cheap damn stupid Martian power packs."
5,4,CAT,0.000000,"So what's the news?"
5,4,KRYTEN,-0.200000,"Well, if I could just beg your indulgence for a few seconds more, sir, the old 345 takes a little time to warm up.  Still, it out-performs the 346 in 8 out of 9 bench tests. A small wonder, then, that it secured "Psi-scan of the Year, Best Budget Model" three years running. Now here are the results. And we're going to ... live."
5,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"We're a real Mickey Mouse operation aren't we?"
5,4,CAT,-0.500000,"Mickey Mouse? We ain't even Betty Boop!"
5,4,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Extraordinary!"
5,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Incredible!"
5,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Hey, look at this!"
5,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Anesthesis stasis pods!"
5,4,LISTER,0.000000,"I must have triggered something."
5,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Doctor? Doctor Lanstrom?"
5,4,LISTER,-0.333333,"Hi. We were just passing. We heard the beacon."
5,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Why can't we ever meet anyone nice?"
5,4,CAT,-1.000000,"Why don't we ever meet anyone who can shoot straight?"
5,4,RIMMER,-0.250000,"I'm telling you, Kryten is taking over, slowly but surely. Remember how he used to be in the early days? A gibbering wreck, completely un-assertive, no self confidence, plagued by guilt, and convinced he was fourth rate. I really liked him then."
5,4,HOLLY,-1.000000,"Escape pod checked and standing by."
5,4,RIMMER,1.000000,"Well, check it again."
5,4,HOLLY,-1.000000,"I've done three complete checks -- it's ready to launch."
5,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Right, I'm going."
5,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"What really gets me, is the way he thinks he can order me about. Well, he who lives by the rule book, dies by the rule book."
5,4,LISTER,0.666667,"If you can hear us, it's me! Listen now, Lanstrom's got some holo-virus. She's totally barking!"
5,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Listy?"
5,4,LISTER,-2.000000,"We need backup, man, we need it bad and we need it now!"
5,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Everything OK?"
5,4,LISTER,0.000000,"What, can't you hear me?!"
5,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I'm sorry, Lister, you're very faint."
5,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Dr. Lanstrom has contracted some sort of mutated holo-plague and is in a fearful psychopathic fury."
5,4,RIMMER,0.500000,"Marvellous! I'm sure she'll be a valuable asset to the team."
5,4,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Sir, I'm going to change frequency. Can you hear me now?"
5,4,RIMMER,0.500000,"Are you really? How absolutely splendid."
5,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I give in, Dr. Fruit-Loop, do tell me."
5,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Well we know what to get you for Christmas: a double lobotomy and 10 rolls of rubber wallpaper."
5,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Where is she?"
5,4,KRYTEN,1.000000,"It appears she's toying with us, sir."
5,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"What kind of disease is it that gives her Hex Vision?"
5,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Clearly some kind of psi-virus, sir. It appears to stimulate the dormant psychic areas of the brain which, up till now, human-kind has been unable to harness."
5,4,KRYTEN,-2.000000,"Unfortunately it requires so much energy it drains the victim's life-force."
5,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"That's why she was in the Stasis Pod?"
5,4,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Precisely. Lanstrom was preserving what little lifespan remains her."
5,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well, if she is running out of time, maybe we could just give her the run-around?"
5,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Theoretically a sound notion, sir. Unfortunately--"
5,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Poor woman. Destroyed by her own genius."
5,4,CAT,0.000000,"Genius?"
5,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Oh, yes. From what little I've seen of her research here, before the holo-virus she had a quite remarkable mind. If I'm right, the fruits of her work should live on."
5,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Anything?"
5,4,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Quite extraordinary. Lanstrom postulated that there are two kinds of virus. Positive and negative. The negative we already know about."
5,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Yeah, like the flu, rabies, that kind of stuff."
5,4,KRYTEN,1.000000,"But she also believed that there are positive viral strains which actually make human beings feel better."
5,4,CAT,0.000000,"Such as?"
5,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well, at a very basic level she predicted a kind of "reverse flu" -- a strain of virus which promotes an unaccountable feeling of well- being and happiness."
5,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"That's happened to me! Me life's been turned to complete and utter crud, and I've woken up in the morning feeling good for no apparent reason!"
5,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"The chances are, sir, that on those occasions you had unwittingly contracted Lanstrom's virus. According to her notes, twentieth-century DJs suffered from it all the time."
5,4,CAT,0.000000,"So what's in the tubes?"
5,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Lanstrom claims to have isolated several strains of positive virus: inspiration, charisma, sexual magnetism--"
5,4,CAT,-1.000000,"Sexual magnetism is a virus? Then get me to a hospital, I'm a terminal case!"
5,4,KRYTEN,0.500000,"This one is the most intriguing of all. According to her notes, this is the viral strain Felicitus Populi, commonly known as "luck.""
5,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Luck is a virus?"
5,4,KRYTEN,0.666667,"A positive virus which most humans contract at some point in their lives for very short periods. And here it is: Lady Luck in liquid form. Want to try some?"
5,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Is it safe?"
5,4,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Absolutely harmless. Even so, this is a minute dose and will only last about three minutes."
5,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Now, I want you to pick out all the aces from this pack of cards."
5,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Shuffle them?"
5,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Mmm hmm."
5,4,KRYTEN,0.250000,"13 to 1. 221 to 1. 5525 to 1. 270725 to 1!"
5,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Sir, I want you to throw this dart over here into that bulls eye behind you using your left hand, without looking."
5,4,LISTER,0.000000,"What, using my left hand? Into the Bulls-eye? Without looking? No chance."
5,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Trust me, sir."
5,4,CAT,0.000000,"You ready?"
5,4,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Ahh. I think that indicates the luck virus has worn off."
5,4,HOLLY,-1.000000,"When you're quite finished, chaps, we've got a bit of a problem with the cargo bay doors."
5,4,LISTER,0.000000,"What sort of problem?"
5,4,HOLLY,-0.500000,"They won't open. Rimmer's put in an override."
5,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Welcome home gentlemen! If you would like to proceed to the aft, you'll find the landing lights on in bay 47."
5,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Bay 47? That's quarantine!"
5,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Spot on."
5,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"But sir, I've screened us all: we're clean."
5,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Well, much as I trust a viral screening conducted by an automated toilet attendant, I really must draw your attention to Space Corps directive 595."
5,4,CAT,0.000000,"For cryin' out loud!"
5,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I have no intention of contracting the hologrammatic equivalent of foaming dog fever. So gentlemen, if you'd all like to proceed to Quarantine Room 152 where you will be spending the next three months."
5,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Twelve weeks. I have a deep, dark sense of foreboding about this."
5,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Aw c'mon, we'll get through it."
5,4,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"This is single quarters! One chair, one bed, one shower."
5,4,LISTER,1.000000,"We'll manage!"
5,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Sir, it's a scientific fact that the human male needs to spend time by himself!"
5,4,LISTER,0.000000,"It is?"
5,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Yes! The most popular pastimes have always been ones that males can enjoy alone: angling, golf, and of course the all time number one."
5,4,CAT,0.000000,"It's not just humans! Look what happens when two male tigers are locked up together! One of them winds up on the other guy's toothpick!"
5,4,KRYTEN,-2.000000,"Lions, tigers, scorpions, rats, even vultures when they're in captivity."
5,4,LISTER,0.000000,"What are you saying to me? Vultures need personal space? They need like time alone if they're to put their feet up and read "What Carcass Magazine?""
5,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Sir, I think you're downplaying the gravity of the situation."
5,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"Look, what difference does it make? We hang out most of the time together anyway."
5,4,CAT,-0.500000,"Yeah, but we all knew we could stroll out the door at anytime. Not now, though."
5,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Welcome to quarantine, lads. I hope the next 84 days pass as swiftly and as pleasantly as the 100-years war."
5,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Sir, I must protest. You only supplied us with single-berth accommodation!"
5,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Space Corps directive 597 clearly states "One berth per registered crew member." And as Listy is the only registered crew member, 1 berth is all you get."
5,4,CAT,0.000000,"Don't rise to him."
5,4,KRYTEN,-0.666667,"What about entertainment? You are obliged to provide us with minimum leisure facilities. Games, literature, hobby activities, motion pictures."
5,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"And in accordance with Space Corps directive 312, you'll find in the storage cupboard over there a chess set with 31 missing pieces, a knitting magazine with a pull-out special on crocheted hats, a puzzle magazine with all the crosswords completed and a video of the excellent cinematic treat, "Wall-papering, Painting, and Stipling -- a DIY guide.""
5,4,CAT,0.000000,"Don't rise to him."
5,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"And fulfilling all Space Corps dietary requirements, dinner tonight, gentlemen, will consist of sprout soup, followed by sprout salad, and for desert -- I think you'll like it, rather unusual -- sprout crumble."
5,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Rimmer, you know damn well sprouts make me chuck."
5,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Well, this is awful. I've got you down for sprouts almost every meal.  I tell a lie. It is every meal."
5,4,LISTER,0.000000,"How long are you going to keep this up for, Rimmer?"
5,4,RIMMER,-0.200000,"Keep what up? I'm merely executing Space Corps Directive 595! Anyway, must dash-erooni. I've got to organise your daily provision of musical entertainment. I think you're going to like it: It's a perpetually-looped tape of "Reggie Dixon's Tango Treats.""
5,4,CAT,-0.250000,"OK! Time to rise to him. Let me out of here! I'll kill him!"
5,4,LISTER,-0.333333,"Listen, guys, he wants us to get on each other's nerves; go through twelve weeks of hell. Well, we're not gonna give him the satisfaction, OK? Cos the entire time we're here, we're not gonna have one single argument, not a raised voice or a cross word. Not one angry exchange.  OK?  OK?"
5,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Boys from the Dwarf."
5,4,KRYTEN,-0.250000,"Urg. I think that's straight now. Two hours it's taken me to panel-beat my head back into shape.  Two damn hours!"
5,4,LISTER,0.500000,"Guys! Just take it easy!"
5,4,CAT,-1.000000,"If he tells me to "take it easy" one more time, I swear I'm gonna turn his ears into a pair of maraccas and tap-dance a fandango on his throat!"
5,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"I'm just sayin', there's 79 more days to go."
5,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"And if you still want to be alive when there is only 78 more days to go, I suggest you do not blow your nose."
5,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Do you mind if I ask why?"
5,4,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Well, let's forego the noise and the revolting burbling sound, and go straight to the really gross part, when you always, and I mean always, having blown your nose have to open up your handkerchief and take a look at the contents. I mean, why? What do you expect to see in there? A Turner seascape, perhaps? The face of the Madonna? An undiscovered Shakespearian sonnet?"
5,4,LISTER,0.500000,"Rimmer was right about you -- you have changed.  You're getting tetchy."
5,4,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Oh no, now don't call me "tetchy." You know what happens when you call me "tetchy.""
5,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Well I'm calling you it now. That's exactly what I'm calling you. Tetchy! Tetchy! Tetchy!"
5,4,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"Just as well I can't hear you. It's just as well I can't hear you calling me "tetchy." You know what happens when you call me "tetchy.""
5,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Oh no. Oh now, didn't I tell you? Didn't I warn you what would happen?!"
5,4,LISTER,0.000000,"No."
5,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Yes."
5,4,LISTER,0.000000,"No!"
5,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I'm putting it on."
5,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Don't put it on."
5,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I'm putting it on."
5,4,CAT,1.000000,"He's putting it on."
5,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Here I go."
5,4,CAT,1.000000,"There he goes!"
5,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Kryten, if you put that on, I'm not gonna help you out. I'm not helping you again, not this time."
5,4,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"You think I need your help? You think I can't extract my own head from the waste disposal unit?"
5,4,CAT,-1.000000,"It won't be the waste disposal, Frankenstein. This time I'm gonna unscrew your neck-bolts and microwave your head!"
5,4,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Frankenstein was the creator, not the monster. It's a common misconception, held by all truly stupid people."
5,4,CAT,0.000000,"Don't correct me. You know how much I hate being corrected. It really gets my feckles up!"
5,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"It's "hackles," you moron. It really get's your hackles up. There's no such word as "feckles!""
5,4,CAT,0.000000,"Feckles, heckles, hackles, schmeckles. Whatever the hell they are, they're up right now and pointed at you, buddy!"
5,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Yeah?"
5,4,CAT,0.000000,"Yeah!"
5,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"Guys, guys! Look at us, what's happened to us? Five days on a sprout diet with a wall-papering video and a crochet magazine. We've all turned into crazies!"
5,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Just don't call me "tetchy" and don't blow your nose."
5,4,CAT,-1.000000,"And don't play that video and don't correct me."
5,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"OK."
5,4,CAT,0.000000,"OK."
5,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"OK.  We're going to get through this."
5,4,KRYTEN,-2.000000,"That stupid, chirpy optimism; that inane winsome grin."
5,4,LISTER,0.000000,"This is insane! We've been in here 5 days. There's no sign of any virus. We're clean!"
5,4,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"That's it -- 5 days! We've got him! Space Corps Directive 699 -- we can demand a rescreening!"
5,4,CAT,-1.000000,"He'll refuse."
5,4,KRYTEN,0.333333,"He can't! He's playing by the book! We've nailed him!"
5,4,RIMMER,0.500000,"Gentlemen. Your conversation makes interesting listening."
5,4,LISTER,0.000000,"RIMMER, is that you?"
5,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Oh, yes."
5,4,LISTER,0.000000,"'Ow long have you been listening?"
5,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Two, maybe three hours."
5,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well, no one's got any disease, man."
5,4,CAT,-1.000000,"We're clean."
5,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"You have to re-screen us, sir, as per Directive 699."
5,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"No one's got any virus and no one's smeggin' nuts!"
5,4,RIMMER,1.000000,"Well, that's good."
5,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Is something amiss?"
5,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"Amiss? God no, what could possibly be amiss?"
5,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"You don't think there's anything amiss? I'm sitting here wearing a red and white checked gingham dress and army boots and you think that's un-amiss?"
5,4,CAT,0.000000,"No, of course not. It's just that we thought you had gone nuts! We were tryin' to humour you."
5,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I was just doing a little test -- a little test to see if you had gone crazy."
5,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"CHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! If there is one thing I can't stand it's crazy people."
5,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"Well we've passed the test, Rimmer. You can let us out."
5,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I can't let you out."
5,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Why not?"
5,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Because the King of the Potato People won't let me. I begged him. I got down on my knees and wept. He wants to keep you here. Keep you here for ten years."
5,4,CAT,0.000000,"Could we see him?"
5,4,RIMMER,1.000000,"See who?"
5,4,CAT,0.000000,"The King."
5,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Do you have a magic carpet?"
5,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Yeah, a little three-seater."
5,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"So, let me get this straight. You want to fly on a magic carpet to see the King of the Potato People and plead with him for your freedom, and you're telling me you are completely sane?! I think that warrants 2 hours of W.O.O."
5,4,LISTER,0.000000,"What's W.O.O?"
5,4,CAT,0.000000,"You had to ask."
5,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"With ... out ... oxygen. No oxygen for 2 hours. That will teach you to be bread baskets."
5,4,LISTER,0.000000,"What do we do?"
5,4,CAT,0.000000,"I think our only hope's the Potato King."
5,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"How the hell did he get the holo-virus?"
5,4,KRYTEN,-0.666667,"It can be transmitted over radio waves. He must have spoken to Lanstrom at some point. I predict we have approximately seven minutes before the air in here becomes unbreathable."
5,4,CAT,-1.000000,"Well, we gotta get out of here somehow!"
5,4,LISTER,-0.400000,"It's impossible. That's the whole point of Quarantine. Nothing gets out; nothing gets in. Not even a microbe. Kryten, any chance of you cracking the code on the door lock?"
5,4,KRYTEN,1.000000,"The chances of punching in the correct combination are literally billions ...to one!"
5,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Unless..."
5,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Of course!"
5,4,LISTER,0.000000,"The luck virus!"
5,4,CAT,0.000000,"Hey, you really think that stuff can get us out of here?"
5,4,KRYTEN,1.000000,"If I give Mr. Lister a suitably large dose, he will temporarily become the luckiest human being who ever lived."
5,4,LISTER,0.000000,"OK, then, what do I do?"
5,4,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Well, you just press in whatever numbers you think are best."
5,4,LISTER,0.000000,"OK."
5,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Ssss--"
5,4,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Last digit, sir."
5,4,CAT,0.000000,"So, what now?"
5,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"We head for the hologram projection suite, before Mr. Rimmer--"
5,4,RIMMER,0.000000,""Before Mr. Rimmer" what?"
5,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"They've been naughty boys, haven't they, Mr. Flibble?"
5,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"What happens to naughty boys who've been naughty, Mr. Flibble?"
5,4,RIMMER,1.000000,"That's right, Mr. Flibble."
5,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"This way!"
5,4,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"The holo-virus is in it's secondary stage. Mr. Rimmer can't have long to live."
5,4,LISTER,0.000000,"What is he capable of?"
5,4,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Well, we've seen hex vision. Almost certainly, like Lanstrom, he'll be capable of telepathy and possibly even telekinesis."
5,4,CAT,0.000000,"Tele-kiny-what-a-noose?"
5,4,KRYTEN,1.000000,"The ability to move objects purely by the power of the mind."
5,4,LISTER,1.000000,"Kryten, man, are you OK?"
5,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I have a medium-sized fire axe buried in my spinal column. That sort of thing can really put a crimp on your day."
5,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Hihi-hidi-hidi-whurdidjid. Two and one-half badgers, please! Hi-yi-yi-yi-yi!  No, I'll eat them here. Whap! An-dingling! Wha-hoo-hoo! An-da-an-shoo-an-shoo. Ah, that's better. Maybe now I can WIN SELF-DETERMINATION FOR THE SOUTH MOLDAVIAN PEOPLE! Nick-noo-nick- noo-nick-ank Ah, I think I'm OK now."
5,4,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Mr. Flibble's very cross. You shouldn't have ran away from him. What are we going to to with them, Mr. Flibble?"
5,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"We can't possibly do that! Who would clear up the mess?"
5,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"We need to use your luck, sir."
5,4,LISTER,0.000000,"How?"
5,4,KRYTEN,1.000000,"What we really need is some kind of remote link to the hologram disk projection system."
5,4,LISTER,0.000000,"What, like this one?"
5,4,CAT,0.000000,"What a stroke of luck!"
5,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Now what we need is a hexangonal power transfer adapter capable of holding spikes of up to 5 million volts."
5,4,LISTER,0.000000,"What's this?"
5,4,KRYTEN,0.500000,"Extraordinary. Now all we need is a B47/7RF resistor."
5,4,CAT,0.000000,"Look out!"
5,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Mr. Flibble says:"
5,4,KRYTEN,1.000000,"I think he's going to be OK, sir."
5,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"He's gonna be OK?  The luck virus must have worn off."
5,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Rimmer? You OK?"
5,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"What happened to me? Where am I?"
5,4,CAT,0.000000,"Quarantine!"
5,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"But don't worry."
5,4,LISTER,1.000000,"We're here to entertain ya!"
5,5,LISTER,1.000000,"Amazing! The last strawberry in the universe!"
5,5,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"Calibrator: locked and set. Organic infrastructure: recorded and stored. Engage the triplicator."
5,5,LISTER,1.000000,"It works!"
5,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"What works?"
5,5,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"We've adapted the matter paddle. Only now, the returning signal is split three ways, so as well as receiving the original object we also get two identical copies."
5,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"This is gonna solve all our supply problems."
5,5,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Taking into account the computations for recalibration I think we can produce four, perhaps even five strawberries a week!"
5,5,RIMMER,-0.166667,"Well, I don't know if the Nobel Prize people run a fruit section, but if they do you've got to be this year's hot tip. Gentlemen, history beckons! You'll be famous. They'll build your statues. They'll even name towns after you. "Dorksville" springs instantly to mind."
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"This machine could revolutionise our lives!"
5,5,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Absolutely. With this little baby running at full pelt, I confidently predict we could have a full fruit salad by the end of the year."
5,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Look, it's not just strawberries! This machine could duplicate anything."
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"It can--"
5,5,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Sir, what's wrong?"
5,5,LISTER,1.000000,"This strawberry's incredible! So succulent! It's divine!"
5,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Is that the same?"
5,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Oh, no, no."
5,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"How's it different?"
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Bitter. Rancid."
5,5,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Sir, can I, uh..."
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Kind of tangy."
5,5,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Sir, I..."
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Crunchy."
5,5,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Sir!"
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Tangy. Kind of chewy. Meaty even. With a kind of wriggly texture..."
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Oh! Smeg!"
5,5,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"It's as if the triplicator has extracted all the very best elements out of one duplicate and all the very worst out of the other."
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"So what would happen if we reversed the process?"
5,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Nice experiment, guys. What do you do for an encore? Neutron bomb juggling?"
5,5,HOLLY,-0.428571,"Rude alert! Rude alert! An electrical fire has knocked out my voice recognition unicycle! Many Wurlitzers are missing from my database! Abandon shop! This is not a daffodil. Repeat: This is not a daffodil!"
5,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Well, thankfully Holly's unaffected."
5,5,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"The engine core is approaching critical mass! We'll have meltdown in less than fifteen minutes!"
5,5,RIMMER,1.000000,"Er, I think a brisk stroll in the direction of the cargo bay could be an outstanding career move at this point."
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"What are you saying? Red Dwarf's gonna blow?"
5,5,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"In less time than it takes a Norwegian to buy ski-boots!"
5,5,CAT,-0.500000,"Hey guys, I think they're playing our tune, the Ahwooga Waltz! Anyone care to join me in a quickstep?"
5,5,RIMMER,1.000000,"Holly, open cargo bay doors."
5,5,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Er, Holly, those cargo bay doors we talked about earlier -- would you mind opening them, please?"
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Holly! The doors, Holly!!"
5,5,HOLLY,-1.000000,"The phrase "Cargo bay doors" does not appear to be in my lexicon."
5,5,LISTER,1.000000,"Manual override!"
5,5,HOLLY,0.000000,"The phrase "Manual override"--"
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Oh! Forget it!"
5,5,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"That's eighty klicks. We should be clear of any possible blast zone."
5,5,CAT,-1.000000,"You really think it's gonna blow?"
5,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"This can't be happening."
5,5,LISTER,-0.600000,"Nothing's gonna happen. We're just here as a precaution. The whole ship's full of fail-safes anyway. Cooling systems, containment panels, vacuum shields. The actual chances of it blowing are about one in--"
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"One."
5,5,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well, according to the charts, the nearest asteroid with an S3 atmosphere is six hours away. The trouble is, we only have enough fuel for five hours flight. I don't think that's going to prove to be a major problem, though, because we only have enough oxygen for seven minutes."
5,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Well that doesn't really affect us, does it?"
5,5,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Sorry, sir?"
5,5,RIMMER,-0.666667,"We don't need oxygen. Now here's a thought. If we ejected their corpses into outer space, would the weight reduction allow us to reach the asteroid?"
5,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Come on Rimmer, that's not the attitude!"
5,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Sorry?"
5,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"That's not the Red Dwarf way! One in trouble, all in trouble!"
5,5,CAT,0.000000,"The posse!"
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"The Boyz from the Dwarf!"
5,5,CAT,-1.000000,"If one of us is in a fix, the home boys band together!"
5,5,LISTER,1.000000,"That's the way it is!"
5,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Have you got anything in writing?"
5,5,LISTER,-0.666667,"You're a toad, Rimmer. You're a weasel. You're a slimy, river- dwelling rodent with the morals of a praying mantis."
5,5,RIMMER,-0.250000,"I'm just being a realist. Look, you only have seven minutes left to live. That's tragic.  God, it's tragic."
5,5,KRYTEN,-0.800000,"If I may interject, sir. In your case that's not exactly true. Remember, you are operating on emergency battery supplies. We have no spares. In fact, you yourself, sir, will expire in a little under four minutes."
5,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Okay, home boys, let's posse!"
5,5,LISTER,-0.500000,"Right. Kryten, get a radar scope -- scan the wreckage."
5,5,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Straight away, sir."
5,5,LISTER,-0.500000,"Cat, get suited up. Maybe some oxygen tanks have survived. Maybe some fuel tanks. Maybe we can get a fix and get out there, and bring them on-board. Meanwhile, turn Rimmer down to minimum power. That way it'll triple his running time."
5,5,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Sirs, there's something out there!"
5,5,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Two objects, far too vast to be debris! According to the backlog, they materialised just before the explosion."
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Can we get in any closer?"
5,5,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Enhance maximum."
5,5,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Of course! The triplicator has made two copies of Red Dwarf!"
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"How?"
5,5,KRYTEN,-2.000000,"Well, presumably when I threw the triplicator into reverse, it didn't reverse the process, it reversed the field of the beam, projecting it out, not in."
5,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"So, instead of copying the strawberries, it copied the entire ship?"
5,5,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Precisely. And presumably the resultant power drain exposed the engine's core and caused the original to blow."
5,5,RIMMER,1.000000,"So, like the strawberries, there are two new Red Dwarves: one, succulent and divine, the other..."
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Fish bait."
5,5,CAT,0.666667,"So what's the problem? We got us a ship! And from what you're saying, it should be better than the original!"
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Not quite."
5,5,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"In the lab, the triplicated copies had a limited lifespan."
5,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"How limited?"
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"About an hour."
5,5,KRYTEN,-0.250000,"Well, there may be a solution. The contents of the ship should be triplicated too. So there will be a working triplicator on-board whichever of the ships is the superior. You see, theoretically, we should be able to reverse the reversal and replicate the original Red Dwarf by amalgamating the two copies."
5,5,CAT,1.000000,"He makes it sound so simple!"
5,5,KRYTEN,0.000000,"We have to find a terminal to re-boost Mr. Rimmer's battery pack. We'll catch you up."
5,5,CAT,0.000000,"Check the music!"
5,5,LISTER,2.000000,"It's magnificent!"
5,5,CAT,-1.000000,"I never heard anything like it before."
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Oooo! Get a lungful of that air, man!"
5,5,CAT,0.500000,"Mmmm! Makes you feel good to be alive!"
5,5,LISTER,1.000000,"Everything about this ship is ... well, it's divine!"
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Hey, let's check the food!"
5,5,CAT,0.000000,"What did you order?"
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Ultimate test: Pot Noodle."
5,5,LISTER,-2.000000,"I tell you one thing: I've been to a parallel universe, I've seen time running backwards, I've played pool with planets, and I've given birth to twins, but I never thought in my entire life I'd taste an edible Pot Noodle."
5,5,CAT,-1.000000,"You're me, but you're not me!"
5,5,CAT,-0.666667,"Extrapo-what-alated? Buddy, there is no way you're a part of me. No part of me would ever be seen alive in sandals!"
5,5,CAT,-1.000000,"That's weird, because I find spiritual and intellectual fulfillment a distraction from the pursuit of clothes!"
5,5,LISTER,1.000000,"Sounds wild!"
5,5,CAT,-1.000000,"Hold me back."
5,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"What a pair of losers!"
5,5,CAT,-0.500000,"These guys are supposed to be part of us? I don't buy it."
5,5,KRYTEN,0.000000,"These are our higher selves. They are the people we could have become if all the negative aspects of our characters were removed."
5,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"You mean hippies."
5,5,KRYTEN,1.000000,"With respect, sir, you think Jesus was a hippy."
5,5,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Well, he was. He had long hair; he didn't have a job. What more do you want?"
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"How come they're so much smarter than we are?"
5,5,KRYTEN,1.000000,"This is my guess: your mind records everything -- everything you see, hear, every word you read, every conversation -- it's all stored in your subconscious. Somehow our higher selves have access to that knowledge."
5,5,CAT,-1.000000,"Look, I'm getting itchy feet here. You got the gizmo, let's scram before the Mad Monk Brothers rope us into an evening of philosophical musings and self-flagellation."
5,5,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"It's not quite that simple. This triplicator has only half the vital components. We need the second triplicator from the Low ship."
5,5,LISTER,0.500000,"Approach pattern plotted. We're gonna just take her in nice and easy."
5,5,LISTER,1.000000,"Okay, keep 'em peeled, guys."
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Is he dead?"
5,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"We can only hope."
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Rimmer? Rimmer? Rimmer?"
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Rimmer? Rimmer?"
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Holy smeg!"
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"What do you want with me?"
5,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Why?"
5,5,LISTER,1.000000,"A holo-whip!"
5,5,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Sirs, we're running short of time. We have less than twenty minutes to find the second triplicator and set it up. I suggest we divide our efforts."
5,5,CAT,-1.000000,"You haven't got a weapon!"
5,5,CAT,0.000000,"I'm going with Bot-Brain."
5,5,LISTER,-0.500000,"You guys are two ladders short of an elopement. What are you after?"
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"I can't move!"
5,5,LISTER,-0.500000,"Game over now, eh? Game over!"
5,5,LISTER,-0.500000,"Oh no! No!"
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"No!"
5,5,LISTER,1.000000,"Ugh -- you guys have got to be yanking my chain!"
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"No way are you part of me."
5,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Ah, but he, he kills. I'm not capable of that."
5,5,CAT,0.000000,"Phew!"
5,5,CAT,0.333333,"Nice movie collection. "Revenge of the Mutant Splat Gore Monster." "Die Screaming with Sharp Things in your Head.""
5,5,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Gore movies. Weapons magazines. This place is a shrine to everything that's low and base. Everything that's designed to sicken the soul and shrivel the spirit."
5,5,KRYTEN,-0.142857,"Urg! Toastie Toppers. Ugh! Cinema hot dogs. Ogh! Sweaty kebabs with stringy brown lettuce coming out! Ogh!"
5,5,CAT,0.000000,"Look at this music! "Hammond Heaven!" "Karaoke Krazy!" "Peter Perfect Plays Tuneful Tunes for Elderly Ladies!" Let's get outta here!"
5,5,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Oh, wait -- here it is!  Clearly, they have no idea as to its purpose."
5,5,CAT,0.000000,"How long do we have?"
5,5,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Barely eight minutes, sir."
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Mmmmph! Mmmmph!"
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Mmmmmmgohahmmmmmmfgh!"
5,5,CAT,0.000000,"I found Goalpost-Head. No sign of Dormouse-Cheeks, though."
5,5,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Sir, we were so worried. What happened?"
5,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"We were ambushed by a platoon of Lows. I was leading a valiant rearguard action."
5,5,CAT,0.000000,"I found him shivering in a box."
5,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"It was tactical maneouvre to outfox the enemy."
5,5,CAT,-1.000000,"As was using his uniform as a temporary latrine."
5,5,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Sir, where is Mr. Lister?"
5,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"We got jumped and he ran off through the storage bay like a gazelle on steroids. We'll just have to leave him."
5,5,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Within four minutes this ship will no longer exist!"
5,5,CAT,0.000000,"Hey, there he is!"
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Mmmmph! Mmmph!"
5,5,CAT,0.000000,"What took you so long, buddy?"
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Mmmmph mmmph."
5,5,CAT,0.000000,"What?"
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Look out!"
5,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"I'm gonna kill ya!"
5,5,LISTER,-0.500000,"I'm a homicidal maniac! My body's being remote-controlled by the Lows."
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Kryten, look out!"
5,5,LISTER,1.000000,"You gotta stop me!"
5,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Shoot him!"
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"What?"
5,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Blow his kneecaps off, it's the only way!"
5,5,LISTER,1.000000,"Give me a break, Rimmer!"
5,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"He's a homicidal maniac, put him down!"
5,5,LISTER,0.500000,"There must be some other way! You've got to incapacitate me somehow!"
5,5,RIMMER,0.500000,"There, Kryten! Hit him over the head with that axe!"
5,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"That'll kill me!"
5,5,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Not if he does it gently!  Come on, he's killing the Cat!"
5,5,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Ooh, what can I do?"
5,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Incapacitate me in a painless way!"
5,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"That was unnecessary!"
5,5,CAT,-0.333333,""Unnecessary?" Look what you've done to my neckline. This stuff never springs back!"
5,5,LISTER,-1.000000,"Oh my God, I think I'm going for the bazookoid!"
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Duck!"
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Left!"
5,5,LISTER,1.000000,"Right!"
5,5,LISTER,-0.500000,"I'm trying to reload! Someone get behind me!"
5,5,KRYTEN,1.000000,"I'm going to come around behind you now, sir."
5,5,LISTER,1.000000,"Okay, Kryten, take me by surprise!"
5,5,KRYTEN,1.000000,"I'm coming around behind you to take you by surprise, sir."
5,5,LISTER,1.000000,"Get on with it, surprise me!"
5,5,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"You may get an unpleasant sensation of chloroform. Don't be alarmed."
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"Surprise me now!"
5,5,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Here comes my surprise, sir."
5,5,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Okay. How long before the triplicator activates?"
5,5,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Less than two minutes."
5,5,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Hurry!"
5,5,CAT,-0.333333,"Damn! A flat battery! Who left the lights on?"
5,5,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"No, it's the magnetic coils. They've depolarised. It's as if the decay on this ship is in some way contagious."
5,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Thirty-five seconds."
5,5,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Try the backup."
5,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Let's get out of here."
5,5,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Yep, all systems check."
5,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"We're up, and looking good."
5,5,CAT,0.000000,"Not again!"
5,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Watch where you're steering!"
5,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Chloroform him!"
5,5,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Oh, wait! I think I've located the spinal implant!"
5,5,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Where is it? I've lost it!"
5,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"It's in his neck!"
5,5,RIMMER,0.000000,"Holly's back!"
5,5,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Mr. Lister, wake up, sir. It's over. We're safe now."
5,5,HOLLY,-0.333333,"Engaging autopilot. Course zero zero mark zero. Taking her home."
5,5,CAT,0.000000,"See what you did to my blouson? Look at it. Plus, you almost killed me three times."
5,5,LISTER,-0.500000,"Sorry, it wasn't my fault. Once you get one of them things in you, you just can't--"
5,5,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Sir, what's wrong?"
5,5,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I think he just sat on the spinal implant."
5,5,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"But it doesn't make sense! Who's controlling him?"
5,5,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I'd better remove the spinal implant and destroy it once and for all."
5,5,CAT,-1.000000,"Uhuh, wait a minute. Just give me one week, that's all I ask."
5,5,LISTER,0.000000,"What are you talking about?"
5,5,CAT,2.000000,"Boy, this is gonna be fun!"
5,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Mr. Rimmer, sir. We've located the black box terminal. You should be getting something now."
5,6,RIMMER,-0.166667,"Confirmed. Ident details: SSS Esperanto. Ocean seeding ship. Mission to introduce oceanic life to potential S3 planets. This was a recon trip. A 3 year check, strictly routine, to make sure that the amino acid chain had taken."
5,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"They had been trying some new enhancement technique to accelerate the evolutionary process. Topped their best projections."
5,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"They got 5 million years of evolution in 3 solar years."
5,6,CAT,0.000000,"So what happened?"
5,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Final entry: routine stuff. They spent the day cataloging and indexing new life-forms. Then it stops."
5,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"The question which occurs: if this ocean is supposed to be teeming with new life forms, where are they all?"
5,6,LISTER,0.000000,"What are you implying, Kryten?!"
5,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"No implication intended, sir."
5,6,LISTER,-0.666667,"Yes there is. You're saying there's some huge damn fish out there, aren't you? Some kind of gigantic, weird, pre-historic leviathan who has porked its entire way through this ocean."
5,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"That's one option."
5,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Any alternatives?"
5,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"None that occur."
5,6,CAT,0.333333,"Hey, wait a minute! I've got it! Don't fish swim south for the winter?"
5,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"No, that's birds, sir."
5,6,CAT,0.000000,"Birds swim south for the winter?! How do they breath?"
5,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"Guys! Rimmer, you getting this?"
5,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"It looks like Norman Bates' mum."
5,6,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"Human, male, Caucasian. Cause of death gunshot wound to the head. From the entry and exit wounds, most likely self-inflicted."
5,6,CAT,0.000000,"Here's another one!"
5,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Two suicides?!"
5,6,CAT,1.000000,"There's more!"
5,6,KRYTEN,0.333333,"A male. Oriental. Clearly he has committed Seppuku."
5,6,CAT,0.000000,"Hey! Look what I found."
5,6,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"Species: unknown. Similar to Earth haddock. Cause of death: suffocation."
5,6,CAT,0.000000,"What?!"
5,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"What is it?"
5,6,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"This fish suffocated in water. It voluntarily closed its own gills."
5,6,CAT,0.000000,"Are you saying that this haddock committed suicide?!"
5,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I'm merely stating the known facts. This fish relinquished its life of its own free will. Damned fool!"
5,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Why would a haddock kill itself? Why am I even asking that question?"
5,6,CAT,0.333333,"Hang five, guys, I'm getting something.  He committed suicide, he committed suicide, he committed suicide, and the fish committed suicide. There's some kind of link here I can't quite make out."
5,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Hang on a minute, guys.  Check this!"
5,6,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"It's an unknown compound. Best guess is some sort of hallucinogenic venom secreted from a piscine source, not unlike Earth's octopus or giant squid."
5,6,LISTER,0.000000,"This is octopus ink?"
5,6,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Well, I'm just completing a chemical analysis.  Err..."
5,6,LISTER,0.000000,"What?"
5,6,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Come on sirs, we have to go!"
5,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"What's happening?"
5,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"We have to go!!"
5,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Kryten, what's going on?"
5,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Entering air lock."
5,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Repressurising now."
5,6,KRYTEN,-0.250000,"Some kind of sea creature, a life form we have never encountered before attacked this ship. Its defense mechanism is a curious one. It secretes a venom, a poison, possibly even a hallucinogenic, which disfunctions its prey by inducing despair. That's why the crew members, and even that fish, committed suicide."
5,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"What about Lister and the Cat?"
5,6,LISTER,-0.666667,"I'm OK. I don't seem to be affected.  It's true, I don't think anyone ever truly loved me in my entire life, but there's nothing new about that."
5,6,CAT,-0.500000,"What's gotten into you guys? This is like Saturday night at the Wailing Wall! Why is it always me that has to be the strong one? I mean you guys just fall apart."
5,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I think we should get back just as soon as we can and then take a mood-stabiliser. I suggest Lithium Carbonate."
5,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I know that emotionally this probably isn't the news you want to hear right now but there's a blob on the sonar scope the size of New Mexico and it's heading your way."
5,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"I think our friend the "Suicide Squid" is about to make an appearance."
5,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Where is it precisely?"
5,6,RIMMER,1.000000,"Directly above you, about 2000 fathoms and diving."
5,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Oh, thanks a lot, Rimmer. You know the state we're in and you have to go and give us news like that. You couldn't have lied?"
5,6,RIMMER,-0.500000,"I was lying. It's only 1000 fathoms."
5,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"We're entering Starbug's airlock now."
5,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"What's it doing?"
5,6,LISTER,0.500000,"It's trying to figure out what we are.  Cut the power."
5,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"This venom -- are we safe in here?"
5,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"It penetrated the hull of a class D Space Corps seeding ship. In comparison we're a sardine tin."
5,6,RIMMER,1.000000,"It's moving."
5,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Where?"
5,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"Down."
5,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Speed?"
5,6,HOLLY,1.000000,"15 knots ... 16 ... 18 ..."
5,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"It's diving."
5,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Course?"
5,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"Collision."
5,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Do we move or stay?"
5,6,HOLLY,-1.000000,"25 knots ... 35 ... 50 ..."
5,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"It's coming straight for us."
5,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"There are only three alternatives. It thinks we're either a threat, food, or a mate. It's gonna either kill us, eat us, or hump us. We can either persuade it that we are not that sort of oceanic salvage vessel or we scarper pronto."
5,6,CAT,-0.500000,"To be diddled by a giant squid on the first date? Think how we'd feel in the morning!"
5,6,KRYTEN,1.000000,"OK, we're going to try and out run it. Holly, hit the power, and give me manual!"
5,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"Change bearing, one zero five. There's some natural caverns about 3 clicks away. It might give us some cover."
5,6,LISTER,0.500000,"That's a yo, Holly!  New course in!"
5,6,LISTER,1.000000,"It's hit us!"
5,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Look out!"
5,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"This is a very, very bad dream, right?!"
5,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I'm not a hologram."
5,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I'm half human!"
5,6,CAT,0.000000,"What the hell's happened to my teeth?!"
5,6,CAT,-1.000000,"I can open beer bottles with my overbite!!"
5,6,LISTER,0.000000,"The next lot?"
5,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Some kind of squid."
5,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Starbug doesn't -- didn't have a laser cannon capability."
5,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"How were we supposed to know that, you Brummie git?"
5,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Me."
5,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Was I supposed to?"
5,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"The Planet of the what?!"
5,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Me."
5,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"You can say that again."
5,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Ahh, I had him sussed right from the beginning."
5,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"What Captain's message?"
5,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"That's a clue?!"
5,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"A blatant clue to what?"
5,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"What truth?"
5,6,RIMMER,-0.500000,"That's because of his parents, his upbringing, his background. The fact that he was never loved."
5,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Yes, yes, yes."
5,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Yes, yes, yes."
5,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"What was it then?"
5,6,LISTER,0.000000,"You what?!"
5,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Jump starts the second big bang?"
5,6,LISTER,0.000000,"What?!"
5,6,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Well, where do we go? We don't know who we are -- our memories haven't returned yet."
5,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"I'm not Lister, then. I'm not me, am I?"
5,6,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"None of us are who we thought we were, sir. This is going to take some getting used to."
5,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I'm not Rimmer, then?"
5,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"No."
5,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I'm not a hologram.  I'm not Rimmer!"
5,6,CAT,0.000000,"Well, if we are not who we thought we were, who the hell are we?!"
5,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"The kind of sad'acs who want to spend four years playing a computer game. Either we're running away from god-knows-what, or we have nothing worth living for in the first place."
5,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Pardon?"
5,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"No, sorry."
5,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Wait a minute. How do you know there is no one called Dwane Dibbley in here? It could be you."
5,6,CAT,-0.666667,"No! No, no, please, no! I don't want to be Dwane Dibbley!"
5,6,LISTER,0.111111,"It's true. It's got your photograph, name, and address on it and everything. There's an anorak in here! White socks. Nylon shirt. Plastic sandals. Aertex vest. Cardigan! Oh, and a key to the Salvation Army hostel."
5,6,RIMMER,-0.333333,"I'm sorry, but I'm afraid it makes perfect sense, Dwane!! Imagine a guy with no `elan, no style -- a misfit. Doesn't it just make total sense that this hapless creature would give his buck teeth to play someone like the the Cat in a computer game?"
5,6,RIMMER,1.000000,"Kryten, open the next one!"
5,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Listen, whoever you are: don't push your luck by ordering whoever I am around. Because, almost certainly, whoever I am, I'm not the kind of guy who's going to take any crap from whoever you are."
5,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"All I said was, "Open the next one.""
5,6,LISTER,1.000000,"Allright, this one's you."
5,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Oh! Who am I?"
5,6,LISTER,0.333333,"Wow! You're a detective! In the Cybernautic Division of the Police Department."
5,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Oh! Golly! Really?"
5,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"Yeah. This is your badge."
5,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"A detective, huh? What's my name?"
5,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Jake. Jake Bullet."
5,6,RIMMER,-0.500000,"On the other hand, "Mr. Bullet," perhaps the Cybernautics division is in charge of traffic control. You just happen to have a rather silly macho name."
5,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"So, whoever you are, who's next?"
5,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"I don't want to know. Someone else look."
5,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"Not necessarily. It's not necessarily me."
5,6,RIMMER,-0.200000,"Billy Doyle. Well, that's a name that came from the wrong side of the the tracks, isn't it? You can see it all now: a youth spent in and out of corrective institutions. A string of illegitimate children. The wife will be all white shoes, no tights, and blotchy legs."
5,6,LISTER,0.000000,"It's yours."
5,6,LISTER,0.000000,"It's yours, "Bill.""
5,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Check the ugly mug on the ID then, man."
5,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"What puzzles me slightly is what a man of such undoubted good breeding would be doing wearing a coat that smells like an elderly male yak has taken a leak in both the pockets."
5,6,LISTER,0.000000,"So, who am I, then?"
5,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Wow! Look at my gear! This stuff's really, really expensive!"
5,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"I work for some company -- CGI. I've got a limo in the long-term car park."
5,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I killed him."
5,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Get in the car!"
5,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I killed him."
5,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"We haven't got time for that, Kryten. In the car!"
5,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I killed a human!"
5,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"In the car!"
5,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Lookout! Fascist cops by the left and they are armed!"
5,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"You're hit!"
5,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"Hello! For the 3000th time, you're hallucinating! Can anyone hear me?!"
5,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Uh oh, speed bumps!"
5,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Chicane!"
5,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Look out -- the barrier."
5,6,LISTER,0.500000,"Brace yourselves! We're going through it!"
5,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Motorcycles! Looks like they're carrying personal rocket launchers!"
5,6,LISTER,0.000000,"That bridge -- think we can make it?"
5,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"It's raising!"
5,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Got any better ideas?"
5,6,CAT,1.000000,"Let's do it!"
5,6,CAT,0.000000,"We made it! Nice driving.  So long suckers!"
5,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Uh oh! Helicopters!"
5,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Oh, I'm going to have to dump the limo."
5,6,LISTER,0.000000,"OK, come on! Go! Go!! Go!!"
5,6,CAT,0.000000,"Down that alley!"
5,6,HOLLY,-0.500000,"Kryten, I'm broadcasting on a higher frequency. Can you hear me now?!"
5,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Did somebody say something?"
5,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"You're hallucinating! Put the gun down!"
5,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I think I'm going to put the gun down."
5,6,HOLLY,1.000000,"Walk forward three paces!"
5,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Have you quite finished being strange?"
5,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"You're hallucinating!"
5,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"You're hallucinating!"
5,6,LISTER,0.000000,"What?!"
5,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"I though you weren't going to make it! Welcome Back to Reality!"
5,6,LISTER,0.000000,"What happened?"
5,6,HOLLY,-0.333333,"You had a group hallucination! Brought on by the ink from the despair squid. You were about to commit suicide, just like the crew of the Esperanto, until the mood-stabilizer saved you."
5,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"The Lithium Carbonate!"
5,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"What? We would have really killed ourselves?!"
5,6,KRYTEN,-0.666667,"Of course! The hallucinations were designed to induce despair! To attack the very things we each consider quintessential to our self- esteem."
5,6,CAT,-1.000000,"That's right, superficial is my middle name."
5,6,KRYTEN,0.500000,"And you, sir. You have always prided yourself on being a good man; a man of moral courage. So, when you thought you were a mass-murdering butcher in a totalitarian state: despair. Despair destined to drive you over the edge."
5,6,LISTER,1.000000,"And with you it was taking a human life."
5,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Precisely."
5,6,CAT,-1.000000,"I'm not Dwane Dibbley?"
5,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"No."
5,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"I am Rimmer."
5,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I'm afraid so."
5,6,LISTER,0.000000,"So, what happened to the Despair Squid?"
5,6,HOLLY,-0.500000,"I took care of that! Limpet mines -- there's enough fried Calamari out there to feed the whole of Italy."
5,6,CAT,-1.000000,"Well, I say lets get out of here."
5,6,HOLLY,0.000000,"Flight coordinates programmed. Switching to pilot cooperation until we hit the surface."
5,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"Those planet engineers really screwed up in a big way here, didn't they? Playing god. The evolutionary process threw up a life force so much stronger and more deadly than any other species -- damn near wiped out everything on the entire planet. Spreading despair and destruction wherever it stuck its ugly mush."
5,6,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Hmm, that sounds rather reminiscent of a species sitting not a million miles away from me now. Ha ha ha!"
5,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"You probably have to be a mechanoid to fully appreciate that one."
5,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Kryten, no one likes a smart-alec android. Hit the retros."
5,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"We're on our way, sir."
6,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Who the hell are you?"
6,1,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Welcome back on-line, sir. How are you feeling?"
6,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"I can't remember anything. I don't know who I am. What is this place? Who are you?"
6,1,KRYTEN,-0.666667,"Ah, you have a touch of amnesia. That's quite common after such a long period in Deep Sleep. You've been out for just over two hundred years."
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Two hundred years?"
6,1,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Actually, I woke you last spring, but you absolutely insisted on another three months."
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"What did you say my name was?"
6,1,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Lister, sir."
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"And you are -?"
6,1,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Kryten. I was just preparing your breakfast tray."
6,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"These cornflakes have got grated raw onions sprinkled over them."
6,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"That's how you like them, sir."
6,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"Do I?  This orange juice is revolting."
6,1,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"That's not orange juice, sir. That's your early-morning pick-me- up. Chilled vindaloo sauce."
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"I drink curry sauce for breakfast?"
6,1,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"Depends on your mood. If you get up in the afternoon, you often prefer to start the day with a can of last night's flat lager. That's why you sleep with a tea strainer by your bed: to sieve out the cigar dimps."
6,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"I drink, I smoke, I have curry sauce for breakfast? Raw onions on my cereal? I sound like some barely human grossed-out slime ball."
6,1,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Oh excellent, sir. It's all flooding back then?"
6,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"No. None of it is."
6,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Perhaps these will help. Your personal artifacts. You asked me to keep them safe."
6,1,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"Kristine Kochanski. You dated her for three weeks once. Before she discarded you for a catering officer."
6,1,LISTER,1.000000,"She's beautiful."
6,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"It's your ambition, sir, somehow to get her back and lie on top of her and move up and down rapidly in that curious way that humans find so agreeable. Personally, I prefer partnership whist."
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Ah! Wait a minute. This feels more like it. Aristotle's Metaphysica. At last -- something wholesome and commendable about me."
6,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Hardly, sir. You use that book to hide your secret Polaroid collection of naked ex-girlfriends."
6,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"God, I went out with a lot of nurses, didn't I?"
6,1,KRYTEN,0.333333,"I don't believe those are authentic uniforms, sir. Note the astonishing brevity of those hemlines. I believe all those girls are imposters, pretending to belong to the medical profession for some nefarious purpose as yet unknown."
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Is this mine? Do I play the guitar?"
6,1,KRYTEN,-0.250000,"Do you play the guitar? Do I have a head shaped like an amusing ice cube? Why don't you chock out a few power chords? See if anything comes back to you."
6,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"The Axeman's back!"
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Don't patronize me. I can't play the guitar. Anyone with half an ear can tell that."
6,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Please, sir -- you are not yourself at present. When you're fully functional, and your personality's restored, you will firmly believe that you can play the guitar like the ghost of Hendrix."
6,1,LISTER,1.000000,"Is there something good you can tell me about myself? Something laudable?"
6,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Laudable... Well, you frequently help me with my laundry duties by wearing your underpants inside out and extending their wear time by three weeks."
6,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"I'm an animal! I'm a tasteless, uncouth, tone-deaf, mindless, revolting, randy, blokeish, semi-literate space bum."
6,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Welcome back, Davey!"
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"What's that?"
6,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Mr Rimmer, sir. He's a hologram, sir. This is his light bee."
6,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Rimmer... He's my best mate, isn't he?"
6,1,KRYTEN,-0.666667,"You are sick, sir. I'm getting woried. Maybe a little synaptic enhancer will do the trick."
6,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Initiating boot-up sequence."
6,1,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Download physical form."
6,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Access personality banks."
6,1,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Download characteristics. Load arrogance."
6,1,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Load charisma."
6,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Load neuroses."
6,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Download memory."
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Oh. That Rimmer."
6,1,LISTER,0.333333,"Good cornflakes. Nice and oniony. Pass me the Tabasco sauce -- just needs a bit more pep in it."
6,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Congratulations, sir. You seem to be on your way to full recall. Next thing you know, you'll be convinced you can play the guitar."
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"I can play the guitar! I'm a diva, man. I can make that lump of wood sing like a Yukon bear trapper on his annual visit to the brothel."
6,1,CAT,0.500000,"That's as may be, bud. But the deal stays the same."
6,1,LISTER,-0.333333,"I know, I know. If I want to strum my guitar, I have to put on a suit and do it in outer space. Peasants."
6,1,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Suggest we begin the debriefing. Mr Rimmer?"
6,1,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Thank you Kryten. Gentlemen, as we're all aware, we have lost Red Dwarf. This is not the time for small-minded, petty recrimination. The time for that is when LISTER is court-martialled after we get back to Earth."
6,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"I didn't lose it."
6,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"You're the one who parked it, Lister. You're the one who couldn't remember which planetoid you'd left it around."
6,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Yeah, but they all look the same, those little blue-green planetoids. They're all sort of little, blue-green and planetoidy."
6,1,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Sirs, please, there's no advantage in finger-pointing. We didn't lose Red Dwarf. Red Dwarf was stolen. By persons... or life forms unknown."
6,1,CAT,0.000000,"Who would steal a gigantic red trash can with no brakes and three million years on the clock?"
6,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Rogue droids... Genetically engineered life forms... Figments of Mr Lister's imagination made solid by some weird space ray. Who knows? The important thing is, after two hundred years of following their vapour trail, we have them."
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"What d'you mean?"
6,1,KRYTEN,-0.666667,"They've been forced to make a massive detour to circumnavigate this asteroid belt. However, Starbug is small enough to negotiate its way directly through the middle. For the first time in two centuries, we have the oppurtunity to head them off at the pass, as it were, and recover Holly."
6,1,CAT,-1.000000,"Well, what are we waiting for?"
6,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Without deflectors? What about Space Corps Directive one-seven- four-two?"
6,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"One-seven-four-two? 'No member of the Corps should ever report for active duty in a ginger toupee'? Thanks for reminding us of that regulation, sir. But is it really that pertinent in this particular situation?"
6,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"One-seven-four-three, then."
6,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Oh, I see. 'No registered vessel should attempt to transverse an asteroid belt without deflectors.'"
6,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Yes? God, he's pedantic."
6,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Rimmer, check out the supply situation.  Your hologram's on battery back-up. We've only got oxygen for three months: water, if we drink re-cyc, seven weeks. And worst of all, we're down to our last two thousand poppadoms. We're in trouble, big time."
6,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"You know how unstable these belts are. Rogue asteroids... meteor storms. One direct hit on that plexiglass viescreen, and our innards will be turned inside out quicker than a pair of Lister's old underpants."
6,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"We're out of options, man. We're taking her in."
6,1,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Recommend the Cat pilots. His superior reflexes and nasal intuition will give us our best chance."
6,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"For pity's sake, one breech in that hull, and we're people pate"
6,1,CAT,1.000000,"There's on ald Cat proverb: 'It's better to live one hour as a tiger, than a whole lifetime as a worm.'"
6,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"There's an old human saying: 'Whoever heard of a wormskin rug?'"
6,1,LISTER,1.000000,"Nice stick work, man."
6,1,CAT,0.000000,"Something's coming."
6,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Nothing on the navicomp."
6,1,CAT,0.500000,"I can smell it.  Something big."
6,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"I'm getting nothing, either."
6,1,CAT,-1.000000,"These nostrils never lie."
6,1,RIMMER,0.500000,"He's right. Co-ordinates 1746 by 9472. Take a peek, gentlemen. There's a meteor bigger than King Kong's first dump of the day, and it's screaming straight towards us."
6,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"It's far too vast to go around."
6,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Reverse thrust."
6,1,CAT,-1.000000,"There's no time. Face it -- we're deader than corduroy."
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Kryten, you know what to do."
6,1,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Lister. Given that we've got as much chance of getting out of this in one piece as a Jammy Dodger that's been dunked in hot coffee and wiggled about for three minutes, perhaps you'd do me the courtesy of explaining what he's doing?"
6,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"He souped up the waste disposal. Filled the eject system with rocket fuel, and turned it into a sort of high-impact garbage cannon."
6,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"A garbage cannon? You're going to try and shoot that out of the sky with tin cans and a banana peel?"
6,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"There's a thermos of nitro-glycerine in there, too."
6,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Waste disposal unit armed, and ready to fire."
6,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Kryten -- will this work?"
6,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Lie Mode.  Of course it will work, sir. No worries. Hook, line, sinker, rod and copy of Angling Times."
6,1,CAT,1.000000,"Here it comes!"
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Bearing zero-seven-niner-two. Fire!"
6,1,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Relocating Red Dwarf's vapour trail. Present speed and course, estimated time of interception, twelve hours, seven minutes."
6,1,CAT,-0.500000,"Check your screens. I'm getting something new, and it does not smell good."
6,1,RIMMER,0.142857,"Enhance four. Nothing. Enhance eight... Sixteen.  Thirty-two... Still nix. Enhance sixty-four. Got it. Some kind of ship."
6,1,LISTER,0.666667,"Wait a minute. There's another one. And another."
6,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I'm getting them too. Ten of them... twelve."
6,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"All derelict."
6,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"It looks like this is some kind of spaceship graveyard."
6,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Anyone else got the feeling that we've been led here like lambs to the kebab shop?"
6,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"We are not moving another inch until we've found out what brought these ships down."
6,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Recommend we stop engines and launch scouter."
6,1,CAT,0.000000,"Engines stopped. Launching scouter."
6,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"We're in."
6,1,LISTER,-0.400000,"Scouter, stop. Go back. Stop. Angle, forty-five degrees to your left. Magnify."
6,1,CAT,0.000000,"What's that?"
6,1,RIMMER,0.250000,"Human remains. Wait. Angle: five degrees right. Ten degrees up. Stop. There: some kind of writing on the floor. P-S-I-R-E-N-S. Psirens?"
6,1,KRYTEN,-2.000000,"The poor devil scrawled it in his death throes, using a combination of his own blood and even some lengths of his own intestines."
6,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Who would do that?"
6,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"Someone who badly needed a pen."
6,1,CAT,-1.000000,"What I don't understand is why he went to the trouble of using his kidney as a full stop."
6,1,RIMMER,-0.500000,"I don't think he meant that. It probably just plopped out."
6,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Whoever he was, clearly he was desperate to warn any poor wretches who wandered into the same deadly trap."
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Scouter's located the black box. Replay final entry."
6,1,LISTER,-0.200000,"OK. Scouter's checked out black boxes on three of the derelicts. This entire belt is swarming with some kind of genetically engineered life form who can alter your perception, telepathically. They're called Psirens. Like with Ulysees in the ancient Turkish legend."
6,1,KRYTEN,1.000000,"I believe the legend was Greek, sir."
6,1,LISTER,-0.666667,"Whatever. Some country that's big on curly shoes and hoummos. the point is, they use this power of illusion to lure you on to the asteroids, strip the ship of anything they can use and suck out your brains."
6,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"They shouldn't bother us, then. There's barely a snack on board."
6,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"We can't turn back. We'll lose Red Dwarf."
6,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"Look, we'll be through the belt in three, maybe four hours. We've just got to be on our toes. They'll try and tempt us, scare us, break our morale - anything to force us down on to the rocks. Just be alert."
6,1,CAT,-0.500000,"Incoming message. It's pretty weak."
6,1,CAT,-0.250000,"You heard 'em -- they want seed-spreaders. I'm going to apply. You guys deal with this Psiren thing. I'll deal with this."
6,1,CAT,-1.000000,"Call me paranoid, but you don't think they were these Psiren dude things...?"
6,1,CAT,0.000000,"Even the brunette?"
6,1,CAT,0.000000,"You don't think there's any chance they're just two nice girls who both happen to want my seed for totally legitimate reasons?"
6,1,CAT,-0.500000,"I don't need to tell you this is a big disappointment. Damn vixens! How could they be so cunning? If anyone wants me, I'll be taking a cold shower in liquid oxygen."
6,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Well, if that's the most sophisticated enticement these Psirens can throw at us, I hardly think we're exactly in danger of being bewitched."
6,1,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"If I may postulate a theory, sir: that was merely the level of sophistication required to lure the Cat. And it worked. Had we not stopped him, he would now be on one of those asteroids, crawling around without his brain, trying to write 'Oh boy, was I suckered' with his own intestinal tract."
6,1,LISTER,0.500000,"Look, we'll make it. All we've got to do is stay on the case."
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Incoming message. Here they come again."
6,1,LISTER,1.000000,"Is this genuine?"
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Kochanski!"
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"I thought you were dead."
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"It's Kochanski."
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Kids?"
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"My sons? But how...? I don't understand."
6,1,LISTER,-0.333333,"Wait! Don't do anything. I'm coming in."
6,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"Kryten -- get the bazookoids. Rimmer -- plot a course."
6,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Lister, tune into Sanity FM."
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"What? Are you saying they were... Psirens?"
6,1,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Of course. It's as plain as a Bulgarian pin-up."
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"You're sure?"
6,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Come on, Listy, you're giving simpletons a bad name."
6,1,CAT,0.500000,"I think you should take a look at this. Something's heading straight for us."
6,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"What is it?"
6,1,CAT,0.000000,"What do you call one of those giant meteorites that are covered in flames?"
6,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"A giant, flaming meteorite?"
6,1,CAT,0.000000,"That's it!"
6,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Should I load the garbage cannon?"
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Wouldn't make a dent."
6,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Plot course change."
6,1,CAT,0.000000,"Engaging re-heat!"
6,1,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Wait! There's nothing on the radar."
6,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"So?"
6,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I think it's another illusion."
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Psirens?"
6,1,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Cat? Are you getting any scent from that meteorite?"
6,1,CAT,0.000000,"Scent? You think there's going to be a duty-free shop on it?"
6,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Can you smell anything?"
6,1,CAT,-0.500000,"No.  Just a little holo-fear."
6,1,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Recommend we maintain current course. That fire-ball does not exist."
6,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Say you're wrong?"
6,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Sir, I'll stake my reputation on it."
6,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Kryten, you haven't got a reputation."
6,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"No, but I hope to acquire one from this escapade."
6,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"It's closing. Too late to run."
6,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Relax, gentlemen, we're quite safe."
6,1,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Well, I can't hang around saving your necks all day. Swagger mode."
6,1,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Guess I'd better make a start on that ironing."
6,1,CAT,0.666667,"I'm getting another one.  Better get Kryten. He'll tell us what to do."
6,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"I'm perfectly capable of dealing with a giant, flaming meteorite, thank you so very much. We do not need to enlist the services of a domestic droid with a head shaped like a genetically flawed lumpfish."
6,1,CAT,0.500000,"OK, keep your H on. So what do we do?"
6,1,RIMMER,-0.666667,"There's nothing on the radar. It's another illusion. We do nothing."
6,1,LISTER,0.500000,"What's happening, guys? Cabin temperature's rising."
6,1,RIMMER,0.333333,"Psirens again. Another illusion. It's all in hand."
6,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Permission to speak, sir?"
6,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Refused."
6,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"What if this time it's a real fireball and the radar read-out that's the illusion?"
6,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Relax, gentlemen. We're quite safe."
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Cat -- chuck a left, man."
6,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Any damage?"
6,1,CAT,-1.000000,"Not too bad. A couple of the sensors are out, fuel-intake chambers are both flooded and the left pilot seat doesn't go up and down any more."
6,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"We came through that intact?"
6,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Starbug was built to last, sir. This old baby's crashed more times than a ZX81."
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"It's the material it's built from. Aerospace engineers discovered that, after a plane crash, the only thing that always survives intasct is a cute little doll. They built Starbug out of the same stuff."
6,1,CAT,-1.000000,"How long before we can take off again?"
6,1,KRYTEN,-0.666667,"Oh, just a matter of ... Wait. The front landing stanchion is embedded in the rock up to its joint. We're going to have to go out there and blast it free."
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"I'll go."
6,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Sir, the atmosphere is thin, and this place is likely to be crawling with Psirens."
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"You sort out the engines. I'll be out there two minutes, maximum."
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"How's that?"
6,1,CAT,1.000000,"Looking good. We'll clear the rest on take-off."
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"On my way back."
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Smegging heck. It's Pete Tranter's sister!"
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Back off, Pete Tranter's sister! I know what you're after: it's moist and pink and it's inside my head. And that's where it's staying."
6,1,LISTER,-0.666667,"I get it. You're trying to make me drown in my own drool. Well, it won't work."
6,1,LISTER,1.000000,"Stay back, Pete Tranter's sister."
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"I admit it's been a while."
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"I prefer to count it in Ice Ages: then it's just four. And if you count it in leap Ice Ages, it's hardly even one."
6,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"that's a long time for a Welsh shepherd who's allergic to wool."
6,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"I can't resist you any more, Pete Tranter's sister."
6,1,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Come on, Dave -- let's get out of here."
6,1,LISTER,1.000000,"Dave?"
6,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Sir? Is everything OK out there?"
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Stand by with the airlock. I'm coming back."
6,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"What's the delay?"
6,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"A couple of Psirens wiped each other out fighting over my brains ... Oh, no. It's the TV weather girl from channel 27."
6,1,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"Sir. Fight it! Don't look at her."
6,1,LISTER,-1.000000,"It's not that easy, Kryten -- you can't see what she's doing with her pointy stick."
6,1,CAT,0.000000,"I'm starting up the engines."
6,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Get back in here."
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"On my way."
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"It's me."
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"I'm in."
6,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"It's getting pretty hairy out there. Come on -- Let's vamoose."
6,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I'm afraid, sir, you're already here."
6,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"What do we do?"
6,1,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"there's no way to tell which is which. We have to let him in."
6,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"That means we'll definitely have one Psiren on board. A brain- sucking psychotic temporal lobe slurper."
6,1,KRYTEN,-0.666667,"There's a fifty per cent chance we have one on board already. We can't risk killing the real Lister. I'm letting him in."
6,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"What about Space Corps directive 5796?"
6,1,KRYTEN,-0.666667,"5796? 'No officer above the rank of mess sergeant is permitted to go into combat with pierced nipples'?!? Pardon me, but how does that possibly pertain to the current situation?"
6,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"5797, then."
6,1,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"To hell with the regs, sir. I'm letting him in."
6,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"On your square head be it."
6,1,CAT,-1.000000,"We're on auto."
6,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Sir, you both look identical."
6,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"We're going to try some tests."
6,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"A series of questions to trick and confuse you. If you fail to answer correctly or for any reason hesitate, you'll be shot."
6,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Kryten?"
6,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Both right-handed. Correct. You have a tattoo on your left buttock, true or false?"
6,1,RIMMER,0.333333,"You. It's dedicated to the one unbending love of your life. Describe the tattoo."
6,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"You. How did you get it?"
6,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Take your shoes and socks off. Kryten?"
6,1,RIMMER,1.000000,"Now, gentlemen: trim your toe nails."
6,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Enough."
6,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Play the guitar."
6,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Play it."
6,1,CAT,-1.000000,"'Cause that dude could play."
6,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"That's how you believe you play, sir. That's why, when the Psiren read your mind, he shared your delusion that you are not a ten- thumbed, tone-deaf, talentless noise polluter."
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Are you seriously saying you think he was better than me?"
6,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"What's the difference? If anything, this is slightly better."
6,1,CAT,-1.000000,"A little survival tip, bud. Never play your guitar in front of a man with a loaded gun."
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"I resent this. I resent you saving my life in this way. I won't forget this."
6,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Where's it gone?"
6,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"It's crawled down to the engine room."
6,1,RIMMER,0.333333,"Meteor storm! Off the port bow. It's a biggie."
6,1,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Recommend you two stay here and man the cockpit. Mr Rimmer and I will pursue the Psiren."
6,1,RIMMER,0.500000,"Um, that's quite a good plan, Kryten. Excellent in all but one detail. I think you know what it is.  'Bye."
6,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"There's no time to argue."
6,1,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Please, I have no desire to hurt you. Let us set you down on an asteroid where your fellow GELFs can attend to your wounds."
6,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"There's no logic in trying to engage me in combat. I am unseducible, in that I have no desires or lusts, and my brain is synthetic and consequently of no interest to you. Give yourself up."
6,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Professor Mamet? My creator."
6,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"What is the function of this illusion?"
6,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"True. However, the others are not so hampered."
6,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"What are you doing?"
6,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"No!"
6,1,KRYTEN,0.000000,"This serves no..."
6,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"You're sick!"
6,1,LISTER,-0.500000,"Kryten? You here? The meteor storm was another illusion. The Psiren's not as badly wounded as we thought."
6,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Kryten?"
6,1,CAT,0.000000,"It's got him."
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Kryten?"
6,1,RIMMER,-0.333333,"My battery's going. Only a few seconds left. Need a recharge..."
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"And then there were two."
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Want a drink, man?"
6,1,CAT,0.000000,"I'm parched."
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Cola?"
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Wait a minute. What's a vending machine doing in the engine room?"
6,1,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"You scum-sucking mollusc. You can't do this to us."
6,1,RIMMER,1.000000,"That's it -- we're clear of the belt."
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"What about Red Dwarf?"
6,1,RIMMER,-1.000000,"According to the navicomp, it's gone into that gas nebula."
6,1,CAT,0.000000,"Then that's where we're heading."
6,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Tea, anyone?"
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"Cheers, man."
6,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Suggest you don't put your cups on the console, sir. It leaves those ugly little ring marks. Why not use me as a table?"
6,1,LISTER,0.000000,"I thought you were going to fix yourself."
6,1,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Not until I've performed all my duties, sir. I can't go gallivanting off engaging my self-repair unit, not when there's a pile of laundry in the washroom the size of the north face of the Eiger. Besides, Cat has invited me to the weekly crap game tonight."
6,1,CAT,-1.000000,"He's gonna be the dice."
6,1,RIMMER,0.000000,"Approaching nebula."
6,1,LISTER,1.000000,"Let's see what's in there."
6,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Ten o'clock changeover. Anything to report?"
6,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"We're still lagging behind Red Dwarf, sir -- almost twenty-four hours behind now. Other than that, it's been a moderately quiet shift, except for one small shock a couple of hours ago when we noticed an alien invasion fleet off the starboard bow. Thankfully it turned out to be one of Mr Lister's old sneezes that had congealed on the radar screen."
6,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"How are we fuel-wise?"
6,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Unchanged for today, sir. However, the supply situation grows increasingly bleak. We've recycled the water so often, it's beginning to taste like Dutch lager."
6,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"We're okay for food, though, aren't we?"
6,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Confidentially, sir, no. We've no meat, no pulse and hardly any grain. Worse still, the only liquorice allsorts left are those {whorly} little black twisty ones that everybody hates. If that weren't bad enough, space weevils have eaten the last of the corn supply."
6,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"So what's under the grill?"
6,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Space weevil."
6,2,RIMMER,-0.333333,"You can't serve space weevil, Kryten. I mean, not even Lister with his single remaining tastebud will knowingly sit down and eat insectoid vermin. Well let's face it - with him it's practically cannabalism."
6,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"But it's incredibly nutritious, sir. After all, it is corn fed."
6,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"You'll never get him to eat it."
6,2,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"Trust me sir. They say the first bite is with the eye. It's all down to presentation."
6,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Et voila!"
6,2,CAT,0.000000,"Change-over! Anything new?"
6,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Oh, nothing much. Electrical storm, alien war fleet - false alarm, the usual stuff."
6,2,CAT,-0.500000,"Look at the state of this place! Why can't you ever clean up before we swap over?"
6,2,CAT,-0.500000,"What the hell is all this down the back of my chair? Peanuts?"
6,2,LISTER,0.000000,"No, I've been trimming my verrucas."
6,2,CAT,0.000000,"You have personal habits that would make a monkey blush!"
6,2,LISTER,-0.333333,"You really think I'm psychotically disgusting, don't you? They're peanuts, okay?."
6,2,CAT,0.000000,"REAL peanuts?"
6,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Yeah."
6,2,CAT,0.000000,"Where'd you get them?"
6,2,LISTER,0.000000,"That derilict a couple of months back. I found them in the dead captain's old donkey jacket."
6,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Don't look at me like that. You enjoyed that mint imperial, didn't you?"
6,2,CAT,0.000000,"And where did you get that?"
6,2,LISTER,0.500000,"He was sucking that when he got shot. I had to prise his jaws open with a car jack."
6,2,CAT,-0.333333,"Uh-huh, you think I'll buy anything you say, don't you? Well, wrong, buddy! Now get out of here - I gotta keep my eyes skinned for that asteroid shaped like a dancing moose you told me about yesterday."
6,2,LISTER,2.000000,"Hi, honey, I'm home."
6,2,KRYTEN,0.333333,"Supper, sir, and tonight's movie. I'm sorry, sir, it is another Doug McClure. Please don't hit me."
6,2,LISTER,0.000000,"What's this?"
6,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Sir?"
6,2,LISTER,-0.333333,"Raw carrot? Kryten, you know how I feel about fresh vegetables - they're for health psychoes, vitamin freaks. People... ...who exercise."
6,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I'm sorry, sir."
6,2,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Is everything okay, sir?"
6,2,LISTER,0.500000,"No, it's not. Some smegger's filled in this "Have You Got A Good Memory" quiz."
6,2,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"But that was you, sir. Last week. Don't you remember?"
6,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Was it?"
6,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Hm. Look: Nobody else spells "Thursday" with an "F""
6,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"I can't help it. I went to art college."
6,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"How's supper, Listy?"
6,2,LISTER,0.000000,"It's delicious. I didn't know we had any crunchy king prawn left!"
6,2,CAT,-1.000000,"I hate to go all technical on you, but... all hands on deck, swirly thing alert!"
6,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Where?"
6,2,CAT,-1.000000,"It's not on the radar yet - but I can smell it."
6,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Nothing here."
6,2,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Nothing on long-range. Sir, is it possible you could have made a mis-smelling?"
6,2,CAT,0.000000,"Listen, butter-pat head, my nostril-hairs are vibrating faster than the springs on a spaniard's honeymoon bed! I'm telling you, there's something out there!"
6,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Don't get your double-helix in a strict! No-one's questioning your nasal integrity."
6,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Go to blue alert."
6,2,LISTER,0.500000,"What for? There's no-one to alert - we're all here."
6,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I would just feel more comfortable if I know that we're all on our toes 'cos everyone's aware it's a blue-alert situation."
6,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"We all are on our toes."
6,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"May I remind you all of Space Core Directive 34124?"
6,2,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"34124. "No officer with false teeth should attempt oral sex in zero gravity"."
6,2,RIMMER,0.500000,"Damn you both, all the way to Hades! I want to go to Blue Alert!"
6,2,LISTER,1.000000,"Ok, ok."
6,2,RIMMER,0.500000,"Thank you. A bit of professionalism."
6,2,KRYTEN,0.500000,"Wait! I've got something - I'm punching it up."
6,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Too small for a vessel... maybe some kind of missile."
6,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"It's impossible to tell at this range. Whatever it is, they clearly have a technology way in advance of our own!"
6,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"So do the Albanian State Washing Machine Company."
6,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Step up to red alert!"
6,2,KRYTEN,0.500000,"Sir, are you absolutely sure? It does mean changing the bulb."
6,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"There's always some excuse, isn't there?"
6,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Range15,000 Gigooks and closing."
6,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Direct collision course. Suggest evasive action!"
6,2,CAT,0.000000,"Engaging re-heat."
6,2,LISTER,1.000000,"It's still with us! It's some kind of heat-seeker - we can't outrun it!"
6,2,CAT,-0.500000,"That's it! We're deader than tank-tops!"
6,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Suggestions?"
6,2,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"Sir? May I recommend I load myself into the reverse-thrust tubes and you use my body as decoy-fodder? This will, of course leave me splattered across deep space and unable to complete today's laundry, for which I apologise in advance."
6,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Kryten, stop your blathering and get in the damn tube."
6,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Kryten, sit down! I'm not doing me own smeggin' ironing."
6,2,RIMMER,-0.666667,"Look, maybe we can reason with it. Open communication channels, Lister. Broadcast on all known frequencies, and in all known languages, including Welsh."
6,2,RIMMER,0.538462,"This is acting senior officer Arnold J Rimmer of the Jupiter Mining Corporation transport vehicle Star Bug. Now hear this, 'cos it's only coming once: We surrender, totally and without condition. Thank you for listening. Oh, additional: sorry to take up your valuable time. Sorry. Thank you. Sorry. Bye. Bye. Sorry. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
6,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Rimmer, you've got a longer yellow streak than a stampede of diuretic camels."
6,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Know this about me: like General George S. Patton, I believe in reincarnation. It is my firm conviction that in all my previous lives I've been a soldier, a bold warrior soul, who tragically in this incarnation has been given the body of an abject coward. So excuse me, gentlemen, while I have a humiliating panic attack under the scanner table."
6,2,CAT,1.000000,"Here it comes!"
6,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Five Gigooks to impact - hang onto your wage packets."
6,2,CAT,0.000000,"The controls are down!"
6,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"What on Io was that?"
6,2,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Some kind of suction beam. We're being dragged down."
6,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Fire up the retros."
6,2,CAT,-1.000000,"Dead."
6,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Auxilliary power?"
6,2,CAT,-1.000000,"Dead."
6,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Joystick?"
6,2,CAT,-1.000000,"Dead. Aw, the entire panel's deader than A-line flares with pockets in the knees!"
6,2,KRYTEN,0.500000,"I've located the beam's source. I'm punching it up."
6,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"So what have we got?"
6,2,LISTER,-0.666667,"Well, it seems we were snared by some kind of malfunctioning guidance beam.  Designed to help docking supply ships. We've shut it down, and we're free to leave."
6,2,CAT,0.000000,"Anyone around?"
6,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"No life signs, nothing."
6,2,KRYTEN,-0.400000,"The ident computer is stubborn as a mule. All I could get from its pesky little ROM was something about classified military research. Wouldn't give me any details. But listen to some of the physicists involved - Heideger, Davro, Holder, Quayle - some of the most brilliant minds of the 23rd century. Whatever they were cooking up here it must have been something pretty special."
6,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Hmm. Anything we can salvage?"
6,2,LISTER,1.000000,"There must be something we can swipe."
6,2,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Well gentlemen, our strategy is clear. Let's tool up and go shopping!"
6,2,LISTER,0.000000,"What? anything?"
6,2,CAT,-0.500000,"I'm not sure. Something."
6,2,CAT,-1.000000,"It's almost off my nasal spectrum."
6,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Strange - a life reading."
6,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Why didn't it register before?"
6,2,RIMMER,1.000000,"You'd better have a mighty damn fine explanation for what you've just done, miladdio."
6,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Hard light?  I've got a body? I can touch?  feel?"
6,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Puncture repair kit on standby, sir."
6,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"But how?"
6,2,LISTER,0.000000,"How come you know who we all are?"
6,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"No, just a bit of Bangalore Belly."
6,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Okay."
6,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Cheers, man."
6,2,CAT,-1.000000,"You come anywhere near me, buddy, you'll be wearing them bowels as a bobble hat."
6,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"What is your name?"
6,2,KRYTEN,0.500000,"Legion... these statues. You sculpted them yourself?"
6,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well, according to my connoiseur chip, they fulfill all ten requirements for being masterpieces."
6,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"You're have a connoiseur chip?"
6,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Just because I look like Herman Munster's stunt man doesn't mean to say I can't appreciate art, sir!"
6,2,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Can I eat? I mean, in this body, is it possible?"
6,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"I can't be hurt!?"
6,2,KRYTEN,0.333333,"His cellular structure is unique! Genetic strands I've never seen before. Part living tissue, part mechanical."
6,2,RIMMER,0.250000,"We've got to persuade him to come with us. He'd get us back to Earth in weeks! And what a team we'd make. Legion, with his scientific genius, intellect, culture and sophistication, and us with... With..."
6,2,LISTER,-0.800000,"With our red alert bulb. Let's flag down a black cab and head for Real Street here. This Johnny won't come with us. He'd never fit in. Can you see him joining in on our late-night sessions of "pin the pointy stick on the weather girl"?"
6,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"True... but once he's signed up and we're off in the Big Black it'll be too late for him to change his mind. All we have to do is create the facade that we're not the uncouth morons you are."
6,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"How absolutely divine, Legion.  Although I must say, our souls are already gorged fit to burst with the feast of art laid out on your walls."
6,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Many's a night we while away the wee hours contemplating a Caravaggio, discussing its shape, themes and form."
6,2,CAT,-1.000000,"The pointy-stick game doesn't get a look-in anymore."
6,2,RIMMER,0.500000,"Hmm. Marvelous.  Now this three-dimensional sculpture in particular is quite exquisite. Its simplicity, it's bold, stark lines... pray, what do you call it?"
6,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"The light switch."
6,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I couldn't buy it, then?"
6,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"It's a pity, 'cos if it wasn't a l-light switch i-in many ways it could be considered a-a masterpiece."
6,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Indeed. It has long been a dream of mine to sample its unique flavours."
6,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I'm fully versed, Legion. For my cooking duties, I'm programmed to be proficient in all known off-world eating techniques, including Jovian Boogle Hoops, and the often-lethal Mercurian Boomerang Spoon."
6,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"Antimatter chopsticks? We use them all the time."
6,2,CAT,0.000000,"Can't even remember what a fork looks like."
6,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Don't let a few congealed custard stains down Lister's long-johns delude you into thinking we're not sophisticates."
6,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"The trick is, of course, to never, ever, under any circumstances, to allow live sticks to touch - but of course we all know that."
6,2,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Well, bon appetite. Tuck in, Listy."
6,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"No, no, after you, man."
6,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Wouldn't hear of it."
6,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Sir, you're creating a reverse field. Try and keep the electron flow in the same direction."
6,2,CAT,0.000000,"How do you land the damn stuff?"
6,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Simply invert the ionic phase in the downpulse of the field margin."
6,2,CAT,1.000000,"I was with you all the way up to "simply"."
6,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Like so."
6,2,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Sir, the glass is fixed to the table. It's Mamosian telekinetic wine."
6,2,LISTER,0.000000,"So how do you drink it?"
6,2,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"You simply will the liquid into your mouth, and then you telepathically decide on its flavour. Thusly:"
6,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Ah. Delicious."
6,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Kryten! Help me!"
6,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Cat, that's mine!"
6,2,CAT,-0.500000,"I can't help it, bud! Somehow we've crossed wavelengths!"
6,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"It feels like you're pulling my teeth out!"
6,2,CAT,1.000000,"Try swallowing it!"
6,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"I have - three times!"
6,2,RIMMER,-0.222222,"Legion: may I be frank? It's not often we meet an individual who we feel could improve our already pretty damn fine top-notch team. But in you, we feel we have. In all our travels, we have met precisely thirty-one individuals: three one. And we have never felt moved to invite a single one to join our crew. True, most of them wanted in some way to suck out our brains, or erase us from history altogether. Nevertheless, they still weren't what we would consider The Right Stuff. We feel that you are different. We feel that you, like us, have the courage and the dignity it takes to make it as a Dwarfer."
6,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Sir! Don't cross the chopsticks!"
6,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"It was Lister, wasn't it? He put you off."
6,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Is there nothing we can do to change your mind?"
6,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Then I'm afraid we must bid you farewell. We have a long journey ahead of us."
6,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Thirty-two."
6,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"My cell. You really are a nutter, aren't you?"
6,2,LISTER,1.000000,"Sugar Puff Sandwiches? Me favourite!"
6,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Two dozen eight-packs and a spare pair of sneakers in the ice- box. Faultless! Not an inch wasted."
6,2,LISTER,-0.333333,"Nothing? What about company? What about people?"
6,2,LISTER,-0.500000,"And that's in some way supposed to make me happy?  S- sorry, run that by me one more time?"
6,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Amazing. Doesn't even need tuning!"
6,2,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Good morning, sir."
6,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"What does he want from us? Why is he so obsessed with fulfilling our every desire?"
6,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"We're all equally baffled, sir. Was your room like everyone else's - perfect in every detail?"
6,2,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Impeccable. Right down to the overstarched pyjamas and nocturnal boxing gloves. What about you?"
6,2,KRYTEN,2.000000,"Filthy walls, mud-streaked floors, mop and bucket... I was in Hog's Heaven, sir!"
6,2,LISTER,0.666667,"When I finally get round to writing my Good Psycho Guide, this place is gonna get raves. Accomodation - excellent. Food - first class. Resident nutter - courteous and considerate. Psycho rating's gotta be four and a half chainsaws. Higher, maybe."
6,2,KRYTEN,-0.666667,"Sirs, we must not be seduced by all this fine living. However munificent our captor, we are still prisoners. And with every second that passes, we lose yet more ground on Red Dwarf."
6,2,LISTER,0.000000,"You're right, Kryten. Cat, caviar niblet."
6,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Bucks fizz."
6,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Let's talk about how to get out of this hellhole."
6,2,CAT,0.500000,"What do we know about this Johnny? And why is he so keen on keeping us happy?"
6,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Is it possible that our well-being is in some way linked to his own?"
6,2,LISTER,0.000000,"What? You mean like he's feeding off our emotions?"
6,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Remember when we arrived, the scans recorded no life signs. Is it possible that our very presence here has in some way inadvertently awoken him?"
6,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Wait a minute... I think I've got a way of getting out of here. Has anyone ever seen "Revenge Of The Surfboarding Killer Bikini Vampire Girls"?"
6,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I think that one slipped us by, sir."
6,2,LISTER,1.000000,"Well, there's this one scene where the good-looking unconventional female journalist who wore glasses and a tight sweater was trapped, deep in the bosom of the surfboarding killer bikini vampire girls' lair, and she came up with this truly award-winning escape plan..."
6,2,RIMMER,0.333333,"Ah. Legion. We have considered our position, and have decided our best option is to make a new life here with you."
6,2,CAT,-1.000000,"What the hell are you, buddy?"
6,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I do?"
6,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"You mean that you are a gestalt entity, not a single creature but a combination of individuals melded together to form one?"
6,2,LISTER,0.333333,"What - you're us? All four of us? Our combined minds and personalities, blended together?"
6,2,RIMMER,-0.666667,"So we can't leave because you're us? You're created from us? If we leave, you cease to be."
6,2,CAT,-1.000000,"So if he's us, he can't hurt us, right?"
6,2,CAT,0.000000,"Wrong."
6,2,KRYTEN,-0.666667,"But this is insane. Hurting us is hurting yourself. Our pain is your pain."
6,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Legion, that kind of tough talk doesn't scare us."
6,2,LISTER,0.000000,"But what about the sculptures and the masterpieces and the technology? Where does that come from?"
6,2,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Heideger, Quayle and the others - the composite of their genius? Your mind must have been extraordinary!"
6,2,CAT,-1.000000,"There's just one thing that still baffles me."
6,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"What's that?"
6,2,CAT,0.000000,"Everything."
6,2,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Sir, permission to test a supposition.."
6,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Granted."
6,2,KRYTEN,1.000000,"trust me, sir."
6,2,CAT,0.000000,"What's going down here?"
6,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"The gestalt requires our consciousness in order to exist. Therefore, as each of us becomes unconscious, his power diminishes. Permission to lay you out, sir?"
6,2,CAT,-1.000000,"Do what you gotta, but don't mess up my hair."
6,2,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Thank you."
6,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Kryten, there has to be a more effective escape plan than this."
6,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Sir, come back. You're just delaying the inevitable."
6,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I can't help it: I'm allergic to being hit."
6,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"You won't feel a thing. I'll render you unconcious using the Ionian Nerve Grip."
6,2,RIMMER,-1.000000,"That's not an Ionian Nerve Grip! That's smashing me over the head with a vase!"
6,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"There's no such thing as an Ionian Nerve Grip. Now stand still while I hit you!"
6,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Your hard-light drive's tougher than vindalooed mutton!"
6,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"This'll do the trick."
6,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"You can't be serious!"
6,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Harder!"
6,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"HARDER!"
6,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"HARDER!!!"
6,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Stop! Stop! STOP!"
6,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Oh, for God's sake! If you want a job doing properly, do it yourself!"
6,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"STOP!"
6,2,RIMMER,-0.333333,"STOP, Kryten! Clearly this is not working. I'm a hard-light hologram, and as such un-knockoutable."
6,2,KRYTEN,0.500000,"Hmm. I think you're right, sir."
6,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"Kryten!"
6,2,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"I'm sorry, sir. I just thought that if I took you unawares..."
6,2,RIMMER,-0.250000,"Kryten!! I'm trying to think, you rubber-headed eunuch!  Right, got it. Turn off my light-bee."
6,2,KRYTEN,-0.666667,"I can't, sir. I can't penetrate hard light. You'll have to extract it yourself."
6,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Now we are even."
6,2,KRYTEN,-0.666667,"Not so. Since the only ingredients in your psyche are mine, you are now incapable of malice. And because a human life takes precedent over the life of any mechanical, you are in fact compelled to assist our safe passage to Starbug."
6,2,KRYTEN,1.000000,"You take the Cat, I'll take Mr. Lister."
6,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"One last thing: in your original incarnation, when you were composed of all those great minds, did you ever develop anything which might assist our pursuit of Red Dwarf?"
6,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Here we go: initiating ignition sequence."
6,2,LISTER,0.000000,"Is this gonna work?"
6,2,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"Well, I see no reason why not, sir. All tests bear out, it is indeed a fully functional stardrive. If we've linked it correctly to the Bug's existing engines, we'll be able to catch up with Red Dwarf in a matter of nanoseconds!"
6,2,LISTER,-1.000000,"Yeah, but it's bound to go wrong, isn't it?"
6,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Sir?"
6,2,RIMMER,1.000000,"It always does for us, every time."
6,2,CAT,0.000000,"He's right! There isn't a dog in hell's chance this stardrive is actually gonna work."
6,2,KRYTEN,-0.666667,"Sirs, haven't we learned over the past two days that if we all pull together we can become greater than the sum of our parts. That if we are of one mind and one intent, there are no boundaries to what we can acheive. This stardrive is going to work: do we believe?"
6,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Do. We. Believe?"
6,2,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well, we know one thing, sir!"
6,2,RIMMER,0.000000,"What's that?"
6,2,KRYTEN,0.000000,"It does work!"
6,3,LISTER,-0.750000,"Let me save you the trouble. It was you that planned Pallisters murder, but your twin sister Maxine squibbed him off. You decided to take the rap, knowing you had the perfect alibi in me. That's why you came on so strong that night: Play me for the dumb sap I am."
6,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Oh yeah?"
6,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"No, sweetlips, I'm gonna let you kiss me."
6,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Sir I think you should come and take a look at this."
6,3,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Sir it really is quiet urgent."
6,3,LISTER,0.000000,"I want you Loretta, I want you body next to mine. I want you like you were that Tuesday night. Kiss me."
6,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Honestly, you haven't been off this machine in a month!"
6,3,LISTER,-0.600000,"It's simple Loretta, this isn't real, it's an AR computer simulation game. I'm supposed to hand you over to the cops and wind up with the goody-goody heroine. I've played it before. It's just that you drive me wild. You're the sexiest computer sprite I've ever seen."
6,3,LISTER,0.000000,"I don't care that you've killed three men..."
6,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"...whatever. It's not your fault, it's the way you're programmed."
6,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Forgive and forget, that's what I say."
6,3,KRYTEN,0.500000,"Choose you chracter. OHHHGGHHH, honestly, I just want to talk to him. Ohhh anything, Sammy the Squib, crack shot with Tommy gun, engage. Ohhh, it's so frivolous!"
6,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Mr Lister sir ??"
6,3,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Hmmm, curious."
6,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Hi Kryten. What are you doing here?"
6,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Sir, I've just got the results of the chemical scan, I've discovered minute amounts of millenium oxide in the local vicinity."
6,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Couldn't be more pleased for you. See you in an hour."
6,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Sir, I believe we've wandered accidentally into a rogue simulant hunting zone. That would explain the devastation on the derelicts where we picked up this very game."
6,3,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Orrrhh, good evening Miss."
6,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"You're trash, aren't you?"
6,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"I can't resist her Kryten, get back in the car. I never fall for women who are any good for me Kryten, it's either heartbreakers or moral garbage on legs."
6,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Sir, you have to turn off the AR console. We have to close down and continue on silent running in order to avoid detection."
6,3,LISTER,0.000000,"10 minutes."
6,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Sir."
6,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"5 minutes, I'll keep my hat on."
6,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Now."
6,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"I'll be back sweetlips. Stay bad."
6,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Kryten, you are a total gooseberry. Next time I play on the AR machine I'm going to give you some money and send you to the pictures."
6,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"At last, we have silent running. OK, long range scanners are down - the only early warning we've got is you. Stay alert."
6,3,CAT,1.000000,"OK bud, I'll keep my nose peeled."
6,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"You took your time. Where've you been?"
6,3,LISTER,0.000000,"I was in the AR machine."
6,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Again??"
6,3,LISTER,0.000000,"What'd you mean again?"
6,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Everyone knows you only use the AR machine to have sex."
6,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"That is not true."
6,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Yes, true. It's pathetic watching you grind away day after day. It's like a dog that's missing it's masters leg. That groinal attachment's supposed to have a lifetimes gurantee, you've worn it out in nearly three weeks."
6,3,LISTER,0.000000,"That is an outrageous scandalous piece of libel. I don't just play the role play games. What about the sporting simulations? Like zero-gee kick boxing and Wimbledon."
6,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"You only play Wimbledon cos you're having it off with that jail bait ball girl."
6,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Is another total lie. She's not jail bait, she's seventeen."
6,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Lister, she's a computer sprite, and surely that's the point; she's just a load of pixels."
6,3,LISTER,1.000000,"Yeah, but what pixels!"
6,3,LISTER,0.000000,"What's all the hullabaloo?"
6,3,CAT,-1.000000,"We've wandered into rouge simulant country."
6,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Bio-mechanical killers created for a war that never took place. Some of them escaped the dismantelling programme and now they prowl around deep space searching for a quarry worthy of their mettle."
6,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I say we should abandon the pursuit of Red Dwarf and flee from the zone."
6,3,LISTER,0.500000,"Give up the chase? Are you kidding?"
6,3,CAT,0.000000,"Wait, my nose is getting something."
6,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Powering up."
6,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Scanners report a battle class cruiser on intercept."
6,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"It's rougue simulants all right."
6,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Recommend immediate total and unequivical surrender."
6,3,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Sir, surrender is the worst thing we could do. They despise humans and all forms of humanoid life. They believe you to be the vermin of the universe sir. ."
6,3,CAT,-1.000000,"I didn't know they'd met him."
6,3,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Getting a message. Punching it up."
6,3,RIMMER,0.666667,"One of us will have to speak to them. Who's the least human looking? Listy, the mike's all yours."
6,3,LISTER,-0.200000,"Wait a minute. I've got an idea. Stall them with static. Kryten mid-section. Cat, you too."
6,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Lister, what the hell are you doing?"
6,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Wait a minute, nearly ready... OK, stand by to transmit."
6,3,LISTER,1.000000,"I am Tarka Dall, an ambassador of the great Vindaloovian Empire."
6,3,LISTER,-0.250000,"Humans!  The Vindaloovian People despise all humans. They are the vermin of the Universe. Is that not right Bindi Baji?"
6,3,CAT,-1.000000,"You bet, we hate them. Scum, scum, scum, scum, scum!"
6,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"The Vinadloovian Empire is pledged to exterminate them all."
6,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"We will not rest until out task is completed."
6,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"Errrrrr, Lister."
6,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Hi."
6,3,CAT,0.000000,"How's it going Bud ?"
6,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I've no idea who you are, but boarding this vessel is an act of war. Ergo, we surrender. And as prisoners of war I invoke the All Nations Agreement article number 39436175880932/B."
6,3,KRYTEN,-0.250000,"39436175880932/B. "All nations attending the conference are only allocated one parking space". Is that entirely relevant, sir? I mean, here we are in mortal danger, and you're worried about the Chinese delegates bringing two cars?"
6,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Can't you let just one go? I was talking about the right of P-O- W's to non-violent constraint."
6,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"But that's 75880932/C, sir."
6,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"It's embarrassing as much as anything else. Here you are totally humiliating me in front of this xenophobic, genocidal maniac...... no offence."
6,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"How long have we been out?"
6,3,LISTER,0.000000,"According to the navicomp, three weeks."
6,3,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"Strange.. the drive interface has been upgraded, and so have the engines."
6,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"And if this readout is correct, we've been armed. Laser cannons."
6,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"They've totally upgraded the whole ship."
6,3,CAT,0.000000,"They've even got rid of the squeak on the seat tilt control."
6,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Let's get out of here."
6,3,CAT,-0.500000,"Wait, I know this game. It's called cat and mouse, and there's only one way to win; don't be the mouse."
6,3,LISTER,0.000000,"What are you saying?"
6,3,CAT,-0.750000,"I'm saying, the mouse never wins. Not unless you believe those lying cartoons. We don't run, we strike. It's the last thing they'll be expecting."
6,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"No, the last thing they'll be expecting is for us to turn into ice skating mongooses and to dance the Bolero. And your plan makes about as much sense."
6,3,LISTER,0.000000,"I say go with it."
6,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Agreed."
6,3,CAT,0.000000,"You're going to go with one of my plans? Are you nuts? What happens if we all get killed? I'll never hear the last of it!"
6,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Nailed them."
6,3,LISTER,0.000000,"What is it ?"
6,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"The navicomp, something's wrong."
6,3,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Shutdown all network links. The navicomp has been infected with a virus."
6,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"The navicomp has frozen us out, we're locked on this course. If we carry on ahead at this speed, how long before we hit trouble?"
6,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Well if you define trouble as a rather large moon directly in our path, about 38 minutes."
6,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Sir, the only solution is for me to contract the virus myself, analyze it's structure and attempt to create a software antidote before it wipes out my core program. Do I have your permission to sacrifice myself, sirs?"
6,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Do Lemmings like cliffs? Granted!"
6,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I am going to have to create a dove program."
6,3,CAT,0.000000,"Dove program?"
6,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"A dove program spreads peace through the system, obliterating the viral cells as it goes."
6,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"The virus is extremely complex. I will have to dedicate all my run time to its solution. Shutting down all non essential systems."
6,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Is there anything we can do? Can we help?"
6,3,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Watch my dreams."
6,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"23 minutes to impact. Any change?"
6,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"Getting worse. Weaker and weaker."
6,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Look, sooner or later we are going to have to face the fact that we are not all going to get out of this in one piece. Or if we are, it's going to one big flat piece."
6,3,LISTER,0.000000,"And?"
6,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"It's time we decided who's going to take the one man escape pod."
6,3,CAT,0.000000,"How?"
6,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Well, if you'll just bear with me, I think I've devised a fair and equitable system of choosing who should survive. It's based on age, rank, seniority, usefulness, and to cut a long story short, it's me. I was a stunned as you are, which is why I demanded a recount. Well, blow me if it didn't come out as me again. Keys."
6,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Rimmer, the escape pod is not an option."
6,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Why not?"
6,3,LISTER,-0.333333,"It escaped last Thursday. I was having a few beers, I couldn't be bothered moving so I used the release mechanism as a bottle opener. Whhoossshhh."
6,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"That's it then, we're finished."
6,3,CAT,0.000000,"Wait, we're getting something."
6,3,CAT,0.000000,"What is this?"
6,3,LISTER,0.000000,"I think we've tapped directly into whatever passes for Kryten's sub-concious."
6,3,CAT,-1.000000,"Why's he a Sheriff in some old western?"
6,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Must be how his core program is coping with the battle against the virus. For whatever reason it's converted the struggle into some kind of dream."
6,3,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Now, now boys, I don't want any trouble. Just doing my rounds."
6,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"You shouldn't ought to have done that Jimmy."
6,3,KRYTEN,-0.666667,"Sorry I tripped over your boot there Mr Jimmy sir. Arrrhhheeemm. Didn't mean any harm by it."
6,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Give me two fingers of your best sipping liquor, Miss Lola, and make it the smooth stuff. The stuff where you get your eyesight back after two days. Guaranteed."
6,3,KRYTEN,1.000000,"I'll be right out."
6,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I don't believe I've had the pleasures, sirs."
6,3,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Well, you seem like a nice neighbourly bunch of boys. How can I be of service?"
6,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"He's losing the battle. Look at his lifesigns, they're barely registering."
6,3,CAT,-0.250000,"Isn't there some way we can get in there and help him? Somehow turn ourselves into tiny electronic people and get into his dream? Isn't there some sort of gizmo lying around someplace that can do that? And if not why not?!"
6,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Look, I think we've all got something we can bring to this discussion. But I think from now on the thing you should bring is silence."
6,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"No, no, no, I think he's got something."
6,3,CAT,0.000000,"Twice in one lifetime! When you're hot, you're hot."
6,3,LISTER,1.000000,"If we link up the artificial reality console to Kryten's mind, we should be able to project directly into his dream state like it was a normal computer game."
6,3,CAT,-0.500000,"What did I tell you? We don't even have to leave the room!"
6,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"What about me?"
6,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"We'll shut all extraneous systems and power up your hard light drive. Come on guys, lets get these wagons rolling."
6,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"There we go, I've loaded in some characters from an AR western game. Choose a player from 1 to 3."
6,3,CAT,0.000000,"Two."
6,3,LISTER,0.500000,"Here you go, you're the Riveria Kid, special skills ace gun slinger. Rimsy?"
6,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Uno."
6,3,LISTER,-0.333333,"One. Dangerous Dan McGrew,special skills, bare fist fighting. Which leaves me with Brett Riverboat, knife man."
6,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"And we definitely can't get hurt?"
6,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"No, it's just like a normal computer game, you can get out at anytime. There's a button on the inside of the glove, when you want to get out, just clap. OK, Riveria, OK Dangerous. Lets mosey on into town."
6,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I've seen Westerns, I know how to speak cowboy."
6,3,RIMMER,0.500000,"Dry white wine and Perrier please. And what about you two chaps?"
6,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"Rimmer, what westerns have you seen? Butch Accountant and the Yuppie Kid?"
6,3,CAT,-1.000000,"Leave this to me, this sounds like one for the Riveria Kid !!!"
6,3,CAT,-1.000000,"Ehhh, Senorita, tequila porfavore."
6,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"He means three shots of gulping whisky, mam."
6,3,LISTER,1.000000,"Very smooth."
6,3,CAT,0.000000,"I was expecting something with a little more kick to it."
6,3,RIMMER,-1.000000," I don't suppose you've got any ginger ale mixers."
6,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"I'll take that as a no then, I'll have it neat."
6,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Sorry, what were the choices again?"
6,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"You'll have to forgive our friend, he's a souple of Gunmen short of a posse."
6,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"OK. You're a fat bearded git with breath that could knock-out a grizzly."
6,3,LISTER,0.000000," Take the lot, man. Rimmer, what is wrong with you?"
6,3,RIMMER,-0.666667,"Relax! You said yourself, Lister, no-one can hurt us. Besides, you're forgetting: I'm Dangerous Dan McGrew, Bare Fist Fighter Extra- ordinaire."
6,3,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Here Lola, all my valuables are in this here box. You can have it all for one bottle of mind rotter."
6,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"No use to me. I've got the shakes so bad, I'm like a couple of porcupines on their wedding night."
6,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I'm throwing in my mule, Dignity."
6,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Mr Sad Git or what?"
6,3,LISTER,1.000000,"Kryten it's us, man."
6,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Sorry friend, I don't believe I've had the pleasure."
6,3,LISTER,-0.666667,"Kryten, don't you know who we are, why you're here? You're fighting an electronic virus, you're trying to create a dove program. Some sort of software antidote to wipe it out."
6,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I'll drink to that."
6,3,CAT,-1.000000,"Listen to him pooch head, the virus is winning, you've got to get your head together and start fighting it."
6,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Now now Jimmy, there's no need to be going make me look foolish."
6,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Leave him alone."
6,3,LISTER,0.500000,"The names Brett Riverboat, knifeman.  Let's see how good you are."
6,3,CAT,0.000000,"The call me the Kid, the Riveria Kid!!"
6,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well, it's been mighty dandy meeting you boys, but if I'm not out of here by sun-up the buzzards will be fighting the lizards for my gizzards."
6,3,LISTER,-0.500000,"If he leaves town, we're dead. Stop him!"
6,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Marvellous."
6,3,CAT,0.000000,"Hey buddy!"
6,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"Hold it!"
6,3,LISTER,1.000000,"You gotta stay!"
6,3,CAT,1.000000,"This is a job for the Riveria Kid!"
6,3,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"But boys you don't understand, I've got to leave. Look : it's ten to Death."
6,3,LISTER,0.000000,"OK, we've got ten minutes to sober him up and get him in shape. Come on."
6,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Sir, I just can't eat anymore raw coffee."
6,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Two more bowls."
6,3,KRYTEN,1.000000,"But I am sober, honest!"
6,3,LISTER,0.000000,"OK, who are you and why're you here?"
6,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I'm some kind of robot who's fighting this virus, and none of this exists, it's all in a fever, except for you guys, who really do exist, only you're not really here, you're really on some space ship in the future. Hell, if that's got to make sense I don't want to be sober!"
6,3,CAT,0.000000,"I got his guns back, and look at the handles. They've got little doves carved on them, and check this, there's no place for the bullets to go."
6,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"This is it Kryten, the answer's in these guns somehow. Doves, dove program."
6,3,KRYTEN,-0.600000,"Wait, somethings coming back now.  You sir. Whenever I look at you I get an image of curry and early morning breath that could cut through bank vaults.  You sir. There's something familiar about you too, I get a name, SmmmEE, SmmEEgGG HHHeeeDD."
6,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Smeghead?"
6,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"That's it!"
6,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"He remembers me."
6,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"The guns Kryten, do the guns mean anything to you?"
6,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Something, they mean something... if only I had more time."
6,3,CAT,0.000000,"PSSSTTT, company."
6,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Now I remember you. You're a computer virus, travelling from machine to machine, overwriting the core program."
6,3,CAT,0.000000,"What is he doing?"
6,3,RIMMER,-0.200000,"He's stalling. He's spotted us for what we are: a bunch of mean macho bad ass desperados. We're going to kick his boney butt clean across the town. Enjoy the show.  Who's got the guts to go with me one on one, hand to hand, mano et mano?"
6,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Cover him."
6,3,CAT,-1.000000,"Damn, I've lost my special skills."
6,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"Rimmer, the virus has spread to the AR unit. We've lost our special skills."
6,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Ahhh, Mr War sir, it would appear that due to circumstances completely beyond my control, there's been a bit of a cock up in the bravado department."
6,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"I may indeed have come across as being more brave than in fact I am."
6,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Exit, exit."
6,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"We're sealed in."
6,3,CAT,-1.000000,"Get the helmets off."
6,3,RIMMER,-1.000000,"It won't move."
6,3,LISTER,0.000000,"Cat the back."
6,3,CAT,-1.000000,"I got one of my gloves off..........and a boot too."
6,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"Ohh brilliant, now you're paralysed compeletely down your left hand side."
6,3,LISTER,1.000000,"Ohhh, me nose!"
6,3,CAT,0.000000,"I've almost got it."
6,3,LISTER,0.000000,"You're pulling my nose off!"
6,3,CAT,0.000000,"Here it comes."
6,3,LISTER,0.000000,"The helmet's coming off."
6,3,RIMMER,-0.500000,"You can't frighten me, I'm always scared. LISTERRRRR!"
6,3,CAT,0.000000,"What now?"
6,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"It's down to Kryten."
6,3,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I'm not afraid Mr Death sir. I believe my friends have bought me enough time to complete the antidote program. Now, if you'll forgive the rather confrontational imperative, go for your guns you scum sucking mollascs."
6,3,KRYTEN,0.500000,"I did it! I created an antidote."
6,3,LISTER,0.500000,"Two minutes till impact. Come on!"
6,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"How long will it take?"
6,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Just a few seconds. How long to impact?"
6,3,RIMMER,0.000000,"Just a few seconds."
6,3,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Loading it up... it's going into the navicomp."
6,3,RIMMER,1.000000,"8 seconds, 7."
6,3,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Nearly there."
6,3,CAT,0.000000,"5, 4, 3 ,2"
6,3,LISTER,-1.000000,"We're not going to make it!"
6,3,CAT,0.000000,"IMPACT."
6,3,CAT,0.000000,"YEEEEEEHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!!!!!!"
6,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"SCRAMBLE,SCRAMBLE. All hands on deck, emergency drill, scramble!"
6,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Er, perhaps you didn't catch that. I said SCRAMBLE!"
6,4,LISTER,1.000000,"Yeah, that'll be great with bacon and beans, man."
6,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Look, Starbug is a blazing inferno, the engine room is waist deep in rocket fuel and we're being attacked off the starboard bow by an unidentified craft!"
6,4,CAT,0.000000,"Really?"
6,4,RIMMER,-0.666667,"No, of course not really. It's a drill. We're pretending that Starbug is on fire and under attack."
6,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"And I'm pretending to scramble, man."
6,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Look, you've got 30 seconds to get out of bed or I'm declaring you officially dead."
6,4,LISTER,1.000000,"Good, then we can rest in peace."
6,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Congratulations, scrambling in a red alert situation, a new record time..... 1 hour 17 minutes and 39 seconds."
6,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"Hey, not bad! And I bet we could bet it down to 1,16 if we cut out that fourth round of toast."
6,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"You think I'm a petty-minded beauraucratic nincompoop, who delights in enforcing pernickety regulations because he gets some sort of perverse pleasure from it, and in many ways you're absolutely damn right, but that doesn't alter the fact that the only way we're going to track down Red Dwarf and get through this is with a sense of discipline, a sense of purpose and wherever possible a sensible haircut."
6,4,LISTER,0.000000,"I'm going back to bed."
6,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Would it harm you to have hair like mine?"
6,4,CAT,-0.500000,"I have got hair like yours. Just not on my head."
6,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Well I'm no stranger to the land of scoff. Perhaps you'd like to explain to me why it is that every major battle in history has been won by the side with the shortest haircuts?"
6,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Oh, surely not, sir."
6,4,RIMMER,-0.333333,"Think about it, why did the US Cavalry beat the Indian Nation? Short back and sides versus girly hippy locks. The cavaliers and the roundheads.. one-nil to the pudding basins. Vietnam, crew cuts both sides... no score draw."
6,4,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Oh, for a really world class psychiatrist."
6,4,CAT,-1.000000,"Check your screens, I'm getting something up my left nostril and it's coming in fast."
6,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Umm, scans are all negative. At the risk of challenging your olfactory excellence sir, perhaps a resmelling is in order."
6,4,CAT,-0.500000,"I'm telling you bud, my nostril hairs are shimmying faster than a grass skirt on a fat Hawaain hula hoop champion. There's something out there."
6,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Scans still dry."
6,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"That's it. I'm invoking space corp directive 68250."
6,4,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"68250? But sir, surely thats impossible without at least one live chicken and a rabbi."
6,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Forget it. Forget I was ever born."
6,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"But sir, I'm very happy to perform the ceremony, but I'm bewildered as to how sacrificing poultry will clear up the screen problem."
6,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"*Wait* a minute, getting something. Major power surge off the port bow."
6,4,KRYTEN,0.333333,"He's right. Some kind of vessel. It appears to be uncloaking."
6,4,LISTER,0.000000,"He's too damn close. That power surge'll toss us around like we're a bead of sweat in an aerobic teacher's buttock cleavage."
6,4,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Hang on here it comes."
6,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Damage report!"
6,4,CAT,-1.000000,"Superficial, navicomps down, slight rupture in fuel pipe 9... and somehow the pilot's headset has got jammed on the country and western channel."
6,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Second wave coming!"
6,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"What's he thinking of, warping that close to another vessel. DAMN SPACE HOG."
6,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"My god, that's a Space Corp external enforcement vehicle."
6,4,CAT,0.000000,"What?"
6,4,LISTER,0.000000,"The space filth!"
6,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"A computer controlled enforcement probe."
6,4,CAT,0.000000,"Incoming."
6,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"The materialization must have scrambled it's voice unit. It's making about as much sense as a Japanese VCR instruction manual."
6,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"It's in reverse. Howdoyouplead?"
6,4,CAT,0.000000,"How do we plead to what?"
6,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"It's charging us with looting space corp derelicts."
6,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"But we don't loot space corp derelicts. We just hack our way in and swipe what we *need*."
6,4,RIMMER,1.000000,"If this goes to trial, I demand seperate lawyers."
6,4,CAT,-0.500000,"What's the penalty for this? If it means wearing outfits with arrows on, I'm committing suicide."
6,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Er, no sir. It means wearing outfits with wings and haloes on, sir. The penalty is execution."
6,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Why so harsh?"
6,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"It's frontier law sir, and we are the equivalent of horse rustlers. Severe sentencing is the only way of maintaining law and order, don't expect it to show us *any* mercy."
6,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"What do we *do*?"
6,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Let's face it sir, we are as guilty as the man behind the grassy knoll."
6,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"Yeah. But if we admit it it'll blow us out of the stars."
6,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Reccomendations?"
6,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Suggest I take the rap for everyone sir. You can say I held you at gunpoint and forced you to do my evil bidding."
6,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"For god's sake, Kryten, we can't let you do that!"
6,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Really?"
6,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Dream on, metal trash. Get your hands in the air and step into that searchlight."
6,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"No choices then, we leg it.  Plot a course for scarper city."
6,4,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Sir, a class A enforcement orb can easily outrun us."
6,4,LISTER,1.000000,"Kryten, the Eastbourne zimmer-frame relay team can easily outrun us. It's not about speed, it's about wit, brains and cunning."
6,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Hmm, I was hoping it wouldn't come to that, sir."
6,4,LISTER,-0.666667,"Take a look at your screens. We're 7 klicks away from the Gelf Zone. It wouldn't follow us in there in a gazillion years."
6,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"No, because gelfs are untrustworthy scavengers with no regard for life, law or property."
6,4,LISTER,1.000000,"Right! So we'll be safe."
6,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Lister, you've heard the stories! They skin human beings alive and turn them into bean bags! Unless you want a triple buttocked gelf sitting on your face for the rest of eternity and probing your crevices for lost forks and biros, I suggest you rethink."
6,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"It's the lesser of two evils sir, in the absence of any sane plan, I suggest we go with Mr Lister's."
6,4,LISTER,1.000000,"Roughly translated... Hit the reheat."
6,4,CAT,-1.000000,"You don't have to tell me twice."
6,4,LISTER,1.000000,"Cat man, hit the reheat!"
6,4,CAT,0.000000,"Oh sorry.  Looks like you do have to tell me twice."
6,4,LISTER,0.500000,"In which case.... boneybuts our move lets!"
6,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Close comms."
6,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Comms closed."
6,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Gelf zone, 6 klicks and closing."
6,4,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Weapon lock registered. Pulse missile launched."
6,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Impact in 10 seconds."
6,4,CAT,-0.500000,"That's it. We're platform shoes, man."
6,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Firing chaffe. Firing flares."
6,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Brace for impact."
6,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Missed us!"
6,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Warning shot across the bows."
6,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"We won't be so fortunate next time."
6,4,LISTER,0.000000,"4 klicks to gelf zone."
6,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Another lock, this time it won't be a warning shot."
6,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Incoming pulse fire."
6,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Decoys launched."
6,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"It's not going to be enough. 6 seconds to impact."
6,4,CAT,-1.000000,"We've got to try and shake them off."
6,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"We've lost it!"
6,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Sorry. I was looking at the wrong panel."
6,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Damage Report!"
6,4,CAT,-1.000000,"It's bad, looks like Starbugs been hit."
6,4,RIMMER,1.000000,"Details, halibut breath!"
6,4,CAT,-1.000000,"Well according to the damage report machine, there's several small fires in the cockpit, lots of smoke and the navicomp's fizzing."
6,4,CAT,-1.000000,"Oh damn, now the damage report machine has exploded."
6,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"*Another* lock on!"
6,4,LISTER,0.000000,"This one's to finish us off."
6,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"How far to the Gelf Zone?"
6,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Klick and a half."
6,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"We've lost 3 fuel tanks, there's barely enough to get us stable."
6,4,CAT,0.500000,"Wait! I'm picking something up."
6,4,LISTER,1.000000,"Got it, putting it on visual."
6,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Look at that thing, it must be a mile and a half across."
6,4,KRYTEN,0.500000,"A Gelf icon carved out of solid rock. It must be some kind of warning beacon."
6,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Incoming message."
6,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Running it through the translator."
6,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Pulse missile launch impact in 12 seconds and counting."
6,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Cat, head for the eye socket."
6,4,CAT,0.000000,"The eye socket?"
6,4,LISTER,1.000000,"Just do it!"
6,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Eight seconds."
6,4,CAT,1.000000,"It's solid rock."
6,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Three seconds.. two ... one."
6,4,CAT,-1.000000,"80 percent of the maneuvering thrusters are out."
6,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"The infrared reports 53 seperate fires."
6,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"The sprinkler systems are down on all 3 decks of the engine room."
6,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"There's no way to put it out, as soon as it hits the fuel tanks we'll blow."
6,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Hey wait a minute. Gelf moon bearing 356 by 121. It's got an ocean.  Can you get us there?"
6,4,CAT,0.500000,"Does mouseshit roll? I'll get you there, bud."
6,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Look at it. All our possesions, all our valuables. Between fire, flood and impact damage we've lost damn near everything."
6,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Well at least Mr Lister's guitar survived intact."
6,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Not *even* Mr Lister's guitar survived intact."
6,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"It's waist high down there, but at least I managed to get the pumps working. 3 hours and we'll be dry."
6,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Thrusters, boosters,reheat, auto-repair can take care of everything, except for the oxygeneration unit which is totally kaputzki."
6,4,LISTER,0.000000,"So you're telling me we can take off but we can't breath?"
6,4,CAT,-1.000000,"And we can't repair it?"
6,4,RIMMER,-2.000000,"It's a black and charred mess, worse than one of Lister's drunken fry-ups."
6,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"Well, we're snookered. Unless we go out and trade with the gelfs."
6,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Trade? You can't be serious."
6,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Sir, it does appear to be our only option."
6,4,CAT,1.000000,"Give me the arrow!  It could tell us a whole heckuva lot about who we're dealing with here."
6,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Anything?"
6,4,CAT,0.000000,"Yep! This sure came from a bow alright..... I was expecting to get a lot more than that."
6,4,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"Hmmm, as we anticipated, they are the Kinitawowi. Good. I have studied the dialect, they are one of the friendlier Kinteteacch, or tribes."
6,4,LISTER,1.000000,"Nice welcome!"
6,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"No sir, it is a great hcanau or honour to be greeted in this manner. They would have killed us the instant we landed if they had taken exception to us. That's a very good sign."
6,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"What? It's a good sign they haven't killed us?"
6,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Absolutely sir, with the Kinitawowi *not* skinning you alive the moment they set eyes on you is one of their warmest greetings. We are indeed hcan hcasset or blessed."
6,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"And Kryten, you are indeed a hcachum babow, or smart alec metal git."
6,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I will tell them we are traders in search of an engine part and that we have many rare treasures to trade. Kinitawowi nhich nhichce histan kanoa nakoo bacoo."
6,4,LISTER,0.333333,"Look, look what we got. We got ehmm, swiss watches, nice watches. Levi jeans!. Hey! A hat, look at this. Hehehey nice hat. Cigar?  Cool dude!"
6,4,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Err, might I suggest caution sir, some gelfs have their sphinctral orifices in their faces Let's hope you haven't offended him. No, he seems quite pleased."
6,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"We need an oxygeneration unit, savvy?"
6,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Agi gan bachwoo machuwahwah"
6,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Cat, get the case man."
6,4,KRYTEN,1.000000,"It seems to be going well."
6,4,CAT,0.000000,"What is that thing?"
6,4,KRYTEN,-0.250000,"It's an emohawk sir. A polymorph that is spayed at birth and is half domesticated. It's trained to change shape at it's owners behest like all polymorphs it's an emotional leech, it has the ability to steal emotions from living creatures. Emotions are a highly valued trading commodity."
6,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Ahh, the oxygeneration unit."
6,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Looks like they are ready to fix a price."
6,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"I thought we'd already fixed a price with all the bangles and baubles we'd given them."
6,4,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Oh no sir, that was just for the honour of entering their watunga, or hut. The bartering proper begins now."
6,4,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Oh dear."
6,4,LISTER,0.000000,"What?  What, you want my hat?"
6,4,LISTER,0.000000,"My jacket?  You want my *jacket*?"
6,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"No sir, he doesn't want your jacket."
6,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"He doesn't want my longjohns does he?"
6,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Not your longjohns either sir."
6,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Well what then?"
6,4,LISTER,0.500000,"*ME*!  He wants me?"
6,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Yes sir, he says in exchange for the oxygeneration unit he wants *you* to be his daughter's mate."
6,4,LISTER,0.000000,"*That's* his daughter?"
6,4,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"One of three. Apparently sir *she's* the looker."
6,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Tell him, not if she was the last water yeti lookalike in the world and I was the only boy."
6,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Oh, come on, Lister, you've dated worse."
6,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Only due to very poor disco lighting."
6,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"He says: no wedding, no O/G unit."
6,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Hmm yes, he's giving us 5 hanaka to decide."
6,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"How long's a hanaka?"
6,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Curiously enough it's exactly the same as one Earth minute."
6,4,CAT,-0.500000,"5 hanaka! That only gives us 28 hours."
6,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"OK, let's get out our sheet music and play the real waltz. There is no way I am going down to Moss Bros for anyone who is less attractive than my own armpit after 20 games of table-tennis."
6,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"What about us? You're not going to hang *all* of us out to dry just because for some reason she doesn't hit your G-spot. What about sacrifice? Putting your friends interests before your own selfish drives."
6,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Rimmer, it would never work out. She's obviously an Aries, and me and Aries, forget it."
6,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Sir, they are a proud people and will not change their minds unless you are prepared to stay here and marry hackhackhack ach hachhachach."
6,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"That's her name? I could never settle down with anyone who's name sounds like a footballer clearing his nose."
6,4,CAT,-0.666667,"The plan is obvious. *We* do the trade, *you* go through with the wedding, when everybody is asleep we come back and rescue you. What do you say?"
6,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Not a chance in hell!"
6,4,LISTER,0.000000,"I do."
6,4,LISTER,0.000000,"What's he saying?"
6,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Erh, you may kiss the bride sir."
6,4,LISTER,0.000000,"What, without a bag?"
6,4,LISTER,-0.333333,"Don't be strangers guys. Seeya *soon*. Drop in *any* time, any time."
6,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Hcanibey yech, onigon yech."
6,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Well darling, what a day I'm pooped, straight to sleep for me."
6,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Maybe in the morning, goodnight."
6,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"You've been looking forward to this, haven't you?"
6,4,LISTER,-0.666667,"OK, just give me a couple of minutes. I want to slip into something a little more comfortable.... it's called Starbug."
6,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"CHANGE OF PLAN LEG IT!"
6,4,CAT,0.000000,"Wait! Somethings coming."
6,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"It's the emohawk!"
6,4,LISTER,0.000000,"What happened? Where did it go?"
6,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"It must have transmuted into something else. Suggest we proceed with extreme caution."
6,4,CAT,0.166667,"It's somewhere close I can smell it.  IT'S THE STICK! AAGH!  Oh, no it's not. Oh god, I'm so jumpy, I thought it was the stick.  IT *IS* THE STICK"
6,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Where is it now?"
6,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"It's gone off into the undergrowth."
6,4,LISTER,-0.250000,"Cat, you know what they're like. Stay on the case. Don't pick anything up. Unbelievable gettimg suckered like that."
6,4,LISTER,0.000000,"100 percent concentration at all times."
6,4,CAT,1.000000,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
6,4,LISTER,-0.666667,"That's it: we're airtight. Damn thing can't get in now.  And all it took was a little bit of concentration."
6,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"How long before we can go? We don't really want a visit from Listy's in-laws demanding their wedding present back."
6,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"It'll take an hour or so to get the oxygeneration unit set up, but suggest we take off now sir and use emergency supplies until the O/G unit's on line."
6,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"What if it doesn't work?"
6,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Then Cat and Mr Lister will choke to death."
6,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"A plan with no drawbacks."
6,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Time we fitted that O/G unit. Kryters!"
6,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I'm on my way sir."
6,4,CAT,-0.666667,"That smell is still driving me crazy. I've gotta wash my hands. Transfering to auto."
6,4,CAT,-1.000000,"It's stolen my cool, it's taken all my style."
6,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"What is it? I heard noises."
6,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Oh my god, where is it?"
6,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"Can you smell it?"
6,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"It could be anywhere, it could be anything. Trust nothing. It may have outsmarted you, but it's going to have to get up pretty damn early in the AM to outsmart Arnie J."
6,4,RIMMER,0.000000,"The gun, the emohawk's the gun. God that was close."
6,4,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Just leave the thinking to me, keyboard teeth."
6,4,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Lister, Kryten, the cat was right. We had brought the emohawk on board, but lucky for you guys old iron buck was around to sort it out..... that's wierd, there's something wrong with this microphone. It's not transmitting."
6,4,RIMMER,-2.000000,"It's removing my bitterness, taking my negativity, slurping out all my snidieness."
6,4,LISTER,0.000000,"What was that?"
6,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"The hydraulic lock sir, we're sealed in."
6,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"It won't override."
6,4,LISTER,0.000000,"You what? It's on board?"
6,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"And the emohawk is still on the loose?"
6,4,LISTER,0.000000,"Well let us in, you need all the help you can get."
6,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"But sir, that would also kill you and the Cat!"
6,4,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"But sir, if we could capture the creature we could extract the DNA strands and re-inject you both. Restore your former personalities."
6,4,LISTER,0.000000,"What a guy!"
6,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"But sir, we've got to save them from themselves, their minds are totally distorted, the Cat's a complete yutz and Mr Rimmer's ... well... *nice*."
6,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"Charge up the bazookoids. We'll blast our way in."
6,4,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Sir, our best chance is to tackle the emohawk together."
6,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"Yeah, one squirt of liquid dillinium, it'll freeze it exactly where it stands in whatever shape it's in."
6,4,KRYTEN,0.000000,"According to the psi scan it's somewhere in this location."
6,4,LISTER,0.000000,"IT'S THE BARREL!  Sorry, false alarm."
6,4,LISTER,-0.333333,"That chain.  IT'S MOVING!! Sorry, sorry."
6,4,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"Sir, try and remain calm, you're experiencing a classic knee-jerk paranoid reaction to a terror situation, it's essential at this time that we IT'S THE WALL!! Shame overload. I..I...I, sorry."
6,4,LISTER,-0.500000,"This is impossible, how can we find something that can disguise itself as anything? How can we lure it out?"
6,4,LISTER,-1.000000,"It's gonna blow."
6,4,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"But, sir how did you know it wouldn't damage your hard light drive?"
6,4,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Well sir, better get you back to normal."
6,4,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"It's the least we can do to thank you sir. And you, Cat, would you like to stay as Duane?"
6,6,RIMMER,0.500000,"Gentlemen, thank you for attending the meeting. Now, let"
6,6,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Sounds like a very good idea, sir."
6,6,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Well, as it's week one, why don't I start? Do you know"
6,6,LISTER,1.000000,"Good meeting."
6,6,CAT,0.000000,"What's eating him?"
6,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well, I'm no psychologist, sir, but maybe the bleak"
6,6,CAT,0.000000,"You can always tell when he's tense. The way he scrunches"
6,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"And he attacked me with that fridge."
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"What happened?"
6,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"He just wrenched it off the wall and tried to insert it"
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"What did you do to upset him?"
6,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Absolutely nothing. I was just sitting there minding my"
6,6,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Extraordinary. It's so unprovoked."
6,6,CAT,0.000000,"The guy's so touchy. If I tried to force-feed you a"
6,6,LISTER,0.000000,"You know what the problem is. Every day it's the same"
6,6,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Oh, ah, you remember, sir. Christmas day, we were"
6,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"Maybe that wasn't such a great example. I'm trying to"
6,6,CAT,-1.000000,"We got nothing to celebrate with, bud."
6,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Oh, not true, sir. There's a whole case of that wine I"
6,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Call me pretentious if you like, but for me, a truly"
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Autopilot alert."
6,6,CAT,0.000000,"Storm front ahead. Switching to manual."
6,6,LISTER,0.000000,"It's a big one -- too late to go round! It's right on"
6,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Stellar fog -- tightly-packed particles from an exploded"
6,6,CAT,0.000000,"Slowing to minimum."
6,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Gentlemen, absolute concentration til we get through this"
6,6,CAT,0.500000,"Don't worry, bud. If there's anything out there, we'll spot"
6,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Anyone hurt?"
6,6,CAT,-1.000000,"No, but my pride sure needs mouth-to-mouth."
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Mr. Lister, sir! He's out cold!"
6,6,CAT,0.000000,"All stop. Let's get him up to the obs room."
6,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"How is he?"
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Not good, sir. Perhaps you'd better look away. I"
6,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Don't worry, Kryten. It's okay when it's Lister's."
6,6,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Impossible!"
6,6,CAT,0.000000,"What?"
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Look!"
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Mr. Lister is a droid!"
6,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"He's a what?"
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"There's no doubt about it. He's entirely mechanical, a"
6,6,RIMMER,-0.500000,"I'm sorry, I'm not buying this. I mean, who created him"
6,6,CAT,-0.500000,"This doesn't tie up. If he wasn't human, I'd have known by"
6,6,KRYTEN,1.000000,"X-rays confirm it."
6,6,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"This is so strange. Mr. Lister's always been an icon of"
6,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"An earlier model? Then how come he looks so much more"
6,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Sir, just because I have a head shaped like a freak"
6,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Alright then, why does he look more realistically human?"
6,6,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Humans have always found exact duplicates rather"
6,6,CAT,0.000000,"Do you think he knows?"
6,6,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Unlikely. He probably reprogrammed his own memory to"
6,6,CAT,0.500000,"This is going to crack him up, devastate him! Who's going"
6,6,RIMMER,1.000000,"I'll write you into my will if you let it be me."
6,6,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"I suggest you leave this to me, sirs. I'll have a talk"
6,6,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Okay. We'll get going and try to get out of this damn"
6,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"What happened? What hit us?"
6,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Something in the stellar fog, sir, didn't show up on the"
6,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"Kryten, you know I don't. I was found under a pool"
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Did anyone ever tell you what was written on that box?"
6,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"It's that tatoo on me inner thigh, isn't it? Well, I"
6,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"It's not the tatoo, sir. There's no easy way of breaking"
6,6,LISTER,0.000000,"I'm a what?"
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"You're a mechanical, 3000 series. Technically"
6,6,LISTER,0.000000,"What does this all mean?"
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Well, in broad terms, I get the front seat in the"
6,6,LISTER,0.500000,"Kryten, have a heart, man. I'm in major stress-related"
6,6,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"You're a droid -- you don't have real emotions. It's"
6,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Kryten, Why are you being so heartless?"
6,6,KRYTEN,0.500000,"Fine, I'll tell you. You encouraged me to break my"
6,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"What was the jolt?"
6,6,CAT,0.000000,"It's a mystery, bud. Nothing on the scanners, nothing on"
6,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"It's like we've gone through some sort of energy"
6,6,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Better run a crosscheck and see if this phenomena is"
6,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Tea, all! Sorry I took so long but I didn't know where"
6,6,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Let me see that tray, please."
6,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Why?"
6,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"That's "why, Mr. Kryten sir" ... You call those"
6,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Okay ... sir.  This doesn't feel right ... Not"
6,6,RIMMER,1.000000,"What a charlatan all these years."
6,6,CAT,0.000000,"Any idea what hit us yet?"
6,6,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Wait, wait, here's something.  Reports"
6,6,CAT,0.000000,"Reality what?"
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Bubbles or pockets of unreality which when encountered"
6,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"From what?"
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"It's a defence device fitted to space corp test ships"
6,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"So we just crashed through an unreality pocket?"
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Which created a false reality making us believe Mr."
6,6,CAT,0.000000,"You mean he's not a ..."
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"No ..."
6,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Tea's upstairs."
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Sir, I, ah ..."
6,6,LISTER,0.000000,"What do you think of the picket fence? (Kryten hides his"
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Sir, may I see your arm? (Through the rip in Rimmer's"
6,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Smeg! It looks normal -- human!"
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Someone else tell him. (looking as if he could burst"
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I wondered if you felt like a nice cold beer, sir?"
6,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Oh sir, how many times can I apologize?"
6,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Don't worry -- I'll think of something ... probably"
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Oh!"
6,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"This fog's getting worse. I say reverse out now before"
6,6,CAT,0.000000,"I hate to agree with Old Laundry-shoot Nostrils, but he has"
6,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Starbug is small. We can probably pick our way through"
6,6,RIMMER,1.000000,"But how can we guarantee we'll ---"
6,6,CAT,1.000000,"We hit one!"
6,6,LISTER,1.000000,"We hit one!"
6,6,CAT,0.000000,"That's what I said."
6,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Where's the Cat?"
6,6,CAT,0.000000,"I'm here."
6,6,KRYTEN,0.500000,"They've taken the Cat! He's gone!"
6,6,CAT,-1.000000,"I'm not gone -- I'm here!"
6,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Someone just erased him from existence."
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Then how come we still remember him?"
6,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Remember who?"
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I don't remember."
6,6,CAT,-1.000000,"Hey buds, don't do this to me! You can't forget me -- I'm"
6,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"I don't get this! We're passing through an unreality"
6,6,CAT,0.500000,"What do you mean everything's normal? I feel invisible!"
6,6,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"This doesn't make any sense! All systems check. The"
6,6,CAT,0.500000,"The four of us! There's four of us! Look! I'm here!"
6,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"We're getting some [bumping in]!"
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Passing back into normal space."
6,6,LISTER,0.000000,"What are you doing?"
6,6,CAT,0.000000,"Can you see me?"
6,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Of course I can see ya."
6,6,CAT,0.000000,"You all forgot who I was. Don't you remember? This is too"
6,6,LISTER,1.000000,"What we have to do is keep our heads."
6,6,CAT,-1.000000,"Boy! This is worse than triple-strength catnip!"
6,6,KRYTEN,1.000000,"The pockets are getting denser and closer together."
6,6,KRYTEN,1.000000,"-- make it!"
6,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"We can't take much more of this."
6,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"Well, just ignore it. All these unreality pockets are"
6,6,CAT,0.500000,"He's right! Let's just keep going and we'll get out the"
6,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"All ahead stop. We have got to talk. Kryten, how far"
6,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"At our current speed, about another three days, sir."
6,6,LISTER,0.500000,"Okay, you win. Let's get out of here."
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Perhaps there is one possibility."
6,6,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"That's it. I've installed a temporary stasis seal on"
6,6,LISTER,1.000000,"See you in three days?"
6,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Where are we? Did we make it?"
6,6,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"We successfully penetrated the mindfield, sir. We're"
6,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"So what was it protecting?"
6,6,LISTER,0.500000,"Derelicts! According to the computer, it's from the 28th"
6,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Crew?"
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"All dead. This was the maiden voyage. They contracted"
6,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"Does this mean what I think it means? We board it, strip"
6,6,LISTER,0.500000,"-- and bingo! We've got ourselves a time machine!"
6,6,CAT,-1.000000,"Let's see if the sucker works!"
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Sirs, choose any year."
6,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Since we can't guarantee this time drive is going to"
6,6,LISTER,1.000000,"He's got a point. Let's go to someplace nice and safe"
6,6,CAT,0.000000,"How about 1421?"
6,6,LISTER,0.000000,"What's the difference?"
6,6,CAT,0.000000,"No difference. I just wanted to make it look like I was"
6,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"Load 1421, Kryten."
6,6,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"1421 loaded, sir. August 17th. Engaging the time drive."
6,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Hey, we did it!"
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Indeed we did. All the ship's chronometers indicate that"
6,6,RIMMER,0.500000,"Give us visual. Let's see what it's like out there."
6,6,LISTER,1.000000,"Okay, punching it up."
6,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Again? We're still where we were!"
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Of course. We're still in deep space, sir, only now"
6,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"So we're still three million years away from Earth?"
6,6,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Well, yeah."
6,6,LISTER,1.000000,"Taking her back to the present."
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Keyed in. Engaged."
6,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"So ... forgive me if I'm being thicker than the offspring"
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Well, at the moment, yes, but should we ever acquire a"
6,6,CAT,1.000000,"Picking up a craft."
6,6,RIMMER,0.250000,"He's right. Some kind of craft. Small. Here it comes."
6,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"It's a Jupiter Mining Corporation core sign. Some kind"
6,6,CAT,-0.500000,"Call me crazy, but that all sounds weirdly familiar. Who is"
6,6,LISTER,0.500000,"It's us from the future! Hey -- incoming SOS message!"
6,6,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Don't punch it up! Close com!"
6,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Why?"
6,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"If that vessel is this vessel, sir, it almost certainly"
6,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Yeah, but Kryten, obviously we've been in some kind of"
6,6,RIMMER,-1.000000,"No, Kryten's got a point. It's too dangerous to make"
6,6,CAT,-1.000000,"We all could if it was you."
6,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"They're trying us again! Come on, they're in trouble!"
6,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Well, in that case, sir, I suggest that I am left alone"
6,6,KRYTEN,-0.333333,"Open com. Present Starbug calling future Starbug. We"
6,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Well, how did it go? Everything okay?"
6,6,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Mr. Lister, sir ... I love"
6,6,LISTER,0.000000,"So what's the SP,"
6,6,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"A little, sir. They are indeed our future selves from"
6,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Listen, if something happens to me, I want to know."
6,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"All I am allowed to divulge is that their time drive has"
6,6,CAT,-0.500000,"So am I actually going to get to meet me? My knees have"
6,6,KRYTEN,0.500000,"Nobody will be meeting anybody. You must be sealed in"
6,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"So when are they coming?"
6,6,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Immediately. I'll serve your supper in the obs room."
6,6,LISTER,0.000000,"They're all my favourites!"
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I know!!!"
6,6,LISTER,0.000000,"How can we have margaritas? I thought we were out of"
6,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I put a little miniature bottle aside, sir, for ... no"
6,6,LISTER,1.000000,"Just go, Kryten!"
6,6,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Thank you, sir."
6,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"His favourite bowl ... his little cup ... the tin opener"
6,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Everything okay?"
6,6,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"Oh, yup yup. Those darn onions get you every time!"
6,6,LISTER,0.000000,"What onions?"
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Ah, the onions I'm about to peel. I always get a little"
6,6,LISTER,-0.666667,"Don't Nixon me, man! Tell me the truth! I die, don't I?"
6,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"All I'm at liberty to disclose, sir, is that all four"
6,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Yeah, but I'm not amongst them, right?"
6,6,KRYTEN,1.000000,"One of their number is called Dave Lister. Now, you'll"
6,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"Hang on a minute -- I'm really confused now. Are you"
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I can say no more. Please, let us not squabble on this"
6,6,LISTER,0.500000,"Careful with those chilies, Kryten. At the rate you're"
6,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Look, whatever it is, there's nothing you can do about"
6,6,LISTER,-0.666667,"I just don't get it. Am I dead or am I alive? If I'm"
6,6,CAT,0.000000,"What precisely are you doing, bud?"
6,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"I'm hacking into the security cameras. Kryten turned off"
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Docking complete. Opening airlock doors."
6,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"Ah, Mr. Rimmer sir, come in, come in."
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Are you really me?"
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"What is that you have on your head? I hope you have a"
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I rather think we're overstepping the bounds of agreed"
6,6,KRYTEN,0.500000,"Sir, you look terrific. I was expecting something much"
6,6,KRYTEN,-0.666667,"Well, blow me! You've hardly changed at all. If I"
6,6,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Well, I can't have changed much. I'm a hologram."
6,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"Wrong. You're two meals away from being a sumo wrestler."
6,6,RIMMER,1.000000,"Let me see!"
6,6,CAT,0.000000,"Am I there?"
6,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Oh yes."
6,6,CAT,0.000000,"What do I look like?"
6,6,LISTER,0.500000,"I can't actually see quite clearly. The light is"
6,6,CAT,0.000000,"What are you talking about?"
6,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"Ha ha! You're as bald as a plucked chicken, man."
6,6,CAT,1.000000,"Let me see! Let me see!"
6,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Wait, wait! I want to see if I'm there. I don't seem to"
6,6,CAT,0.000000,"What? What is it?"
6,6,RIMMER,1.000000,"Ohhhhh dear!"
6,6,CAT,0.000000,"What? Is he fat?"
6,6,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Far from it. He's lost a bit of weight, actually."
6,6,LISTER,0.000000,"What do I do to end up like that?"
6,6,CAT,-0.500000,"That's tragic. That is the saddest thing I've ever seen in"
6,6,LISTER,0.000000,"So what if you're fat and bald. That's what happens when"
6,6,CAT,0.000000,"Self self self self self!"
6,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"We've got to find out what's going on."
6,6,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"We've been saving it for a special occasion. And what"
6,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"He was an idiotic despot who lived in the most obscene"
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"The who?!"
6,6,KRYTEN,1.000000,"You're good friends with the Hitlers?!"
6,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"I don't believe what I'm hearing!"
6,6,KRYTEN,0.500000,"Herman Goering is a "bit dodgy"! What has become of you"
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"I don't recognize any of you! You're just amoral self-"
6,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Okay. That's it. You've got two minutes to get off this"
6,6,LISTER,0.000000,"That's one minute forty."
6,6,LISTER,-0.500000,"What have I got to lose? I'm in a jar."
6,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Fifty seconds."
6,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Twenty seconds. Into the airlock and git."
6,6,KRYTEN,-0.500000,"I knew it would be a mistake to see the future. Now our"
6,6,RIMMER,-0.500000,"Threat warning -- vessel off the stern! They've got a"
6,6,LISTER,-1.000000,"Our future selves are attacking us!"
6,6,CAT,0.000000,"They're nuts!"
6,6,CAT,0.500000,"Direct hit! The gyroscope's out!"
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"They're trying to disable us!"
6,6,RIMMER,1.000000,"Another lock!"
6,6,LISTER,1.000000,"Incoming message!"
6,6,KRYTEN,-1.000000,"But if you kill us, you'll have cease to exist."
6,6,CAT,0.000000,"So what do we do?"
6,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Have we got any chance of winning?"
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Their craft is greatly upgraded. We have no chance"
6,6,RIMMER,0.000000,"Then I say fight!"
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Mr. Rimmer?"
6,6,RIMMER,1.000000,"Better dead than smeg!"
6,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Cheers! Cat?"
6,6,CAT,-1.000000,"Better dead than sofa-side butt."
6,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Kryten?"
6,6,KRYTEN,1.000000,"Better anything than that toupee!"
6,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Shields up! Arming lasers!"
6,6,CAT,0.000000,"Bringing her around."
6,6,KRYTEN,0.000000,"Target acquired!"
6,6,LISTER,0.000000,"Locking on -- firing!"
