Hence the question below posed to a new revamped Holly (The ship&#x27;s computer) who has just had her IQ increased to 12000 and who now knows everything there is to know in the Universe. &#x27;Given that God is infinite and that the universe is also infinite would you like a toasted teacake?&#x27; Oh joy!","rating":"9\/10"}},"donation":{"message":"Please, donate to keep this service alive and help its further development","donation_url":"https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=92KZCBD2PXMZQ"}}
