All the episodes are excellent but &quot;Dimension Jump&quot; stands out as a series classic and one of the best-written episode. &quot;Meltdown&quot; is probably one of the most fun episodes of the entire show with a unique concept and fun execution (the Elvis impersonator being quite impressive especially). Ed Bye, the director of this series, brings the various locations to life quite well. Just a whole load of fun isn&#39;t it? Series average based on ratings of all episodes: 8.83\/10","rating":null}},"donation":{"message":"Please, donate to keep this service alive and help its further development","donation_url":"https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=92KZCBD2PXMZQ"}}
