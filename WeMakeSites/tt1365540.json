It had been a while since they had made anything, and times they had a-changed since.However I tried to remain positive, remembering the good things about Red Dwarf; so when it aired on Dave, I watched. All three painfully unfunny episodes.I want that time back.I just cannot begin to fathom how so many people could think that this was even remotely a decent &#x22;mini-series&#x22; - the jokes were stupid, the references they made to the show during the bulk of the episodes were horrible and self indulgent and everything just made me cringe and wish none of it had ever happened.I hope and pray they don&#x27;t decide to make a new series, based on how bloody awful this three parter was. Regardless of what I read on the internet - die hard fans refusing to see the truth about their &#x22;beloved series&#x22;; I think the scene at Christmas in HMV sealed the deal. The shelves bursting with sad looking Back to Earth DVDs nobody wanted.Avoid like your life depends on it. Your sanity sure does.","rating":"1\/10"}},"donation":{"message":"Please, donate to keep this service alive and help its further development","donation_url":"https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=92KZCBD2PXMZQ"}}
