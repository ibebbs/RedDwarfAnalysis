I was an avid fan since the time my dad bought the first season and the series have gone from good to weird to recounting vindaloo related adventures and more OK so the penultimate series dipped but the last picked it up for the end but they didn&#39;t really finish it, it was probably the single most anti-climatic. yet funny ending ever. as the grim reaper starts his dialogue just to have rimmer knee him in... well its rimmer have a guess, and then it ends it just stops and i don&#39;t know why this was, the saving grace series the best one apart from the first and yet it just stopped. maybe the worst red dwarf episode or the best but rimmer giving the most monumental quote that not even Shakespeare could have written will be a childhood memory that lives with me forever.","rating":"8\/10"}},"donation":{"message":"Please, donate to keep this service alive and help its further development","donation_url":"https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=92KZCBD2PXMZQ"}}
