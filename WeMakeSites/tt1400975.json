OK... So, uh, you&#x27;re going with movie references, Family Guy style?&#x22; There were some excellent quotes in both episodes, though. Then part 3 completely redeemed it.Acting&#x27;s good, plot&#x27;s interesting and it feels much more mature. I&#x27;d definitely say it&#x27;s better than a lot of what Series 8 had to offer.As for breaking the whole affair into three episodes, it probably wasn&#x27;t the best idea, but it&#x27;s being released on DVD so we&#x27;ll all be able to watch it as intended.Oh, one last thing: SO glad they ditched the laugh track! There just aren&#x27;t enough jokes in the show for that to be a good idea; lots of serious moments.-Lexi C","rating":"9\/10"}},"donation":{"message":"Please, donate to keep this service alive and help its further development","donation_url":"https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=92KZCBD2PXMZQ"}}
