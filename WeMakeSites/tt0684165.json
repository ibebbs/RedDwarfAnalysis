It&#39;s a solid 6 episodes that do an admirable job of introducing the characters, but it&#39;s a tad less inventive than some later seasons, and Cat isn&#39;t as funny as he would be later. &quot;The End&quot; is a fine series opener and &quot;Future Echoes&quot; is pure hilarity. From the third episode on the series falters just a little bit but only in comparison to later greatness, and is still very enjoyable on its own. I enjoy &quot;Waiting for God&quot; more than most fans, for whatever that&#39;s worth.Season average based on ratings for all episodes: 7.83\/10","rating":null}},"donation":{"message":"Please, donate to keep this service alive and help its further development","donation_url":"https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=92KZCBD2PXMZQ"}}
