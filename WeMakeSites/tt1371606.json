He gains access to Red Dwarf's confidential files, and then takes up the opportunity when he is invited to dinner with the Captain and the senior officers. To make the evening go with a swing, he douses himself with a \"sexual magnetism virus\" which will make him irresistible to the female crew. In the meantime, Kryten has to come to terms with the fact that he has been classified as a woman due to his lack of male sex organs.

It was pretty funny, but also smart (if a bit recycling). Most importantly, it had a soul, the main ingredient of all the RD episodes. One of the scenes made me laugh until I lost my breath, and I can&#x27;t remember when was the last time that happened.In my opinion, Red Drawf had a much better comeback than Futurama, and I&#x27;m glad it wasn&#x27;t a full-length movie, those always suck.","rating":"10\/10"}},"donation":{"message":"Please, donate to keep this service alive and help its further development","donation_url":"https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=92KZCBD2PXMZQ"}}
