I am a massive Red Dwarf fan and The Inquisitor is one of my all time episodes.The Red Dwarf Crew encounter The Inquisitor, a droid who lived to the end of time itself, and only then it figured there is no god and no afterlife. And so, The Inquisitor invented a time machine and travels throughout history and challenges every person who Ever lived to justify why they deserve to live and what they have done to lead a worthwhile life. Each person who wasted their life is then erased from history and replaced with another version of yourself who never got the chance to live. This proves to be bad for the Dwarfers as Lister and Kryten are erased and have to put things right before they are permanently deleted.","rating":null}},"donation":{"message":"Please, donate to keep this service alive and help its further development","donation_url":"https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=92KZCBD2PXMZQ"}}
