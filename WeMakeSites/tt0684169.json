This series had two classic, memorable episodes: &quot;Kryten&quot;, featuring everybody&#39;s favorite Androids fan in his first appearance (a primitive-looking appearance as well) and &quot;Queeg&quot;, which is just a splendid Holly episode. &quot;Parallel Universe&quot; marks the end of &#39;early Red Dwarf&#39;, leading into the different but improved series 3-6 era of Red Dwarf. This 6 episode series is really excellent in its own right and is great and doing its own thing.Series average based on all episodes: 8.3\/10","rating":null}},"donation":{"message":"Please, donate to keep this service alive and help its further development","donation_url":"https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=92KZCBD2PXMZQ"}}
