          1    Model. Starbug flypast.

               
          2    Int. Starbug Medical Lab.

          
               KRYTEN is pressing buttons on a control panel, while 
               RIMMER lies on a bench.
               
                                        KRYTEN
                    (Moving to the end of the bench) Well, that's 
                    finished the tests sir. We just have to wait while 
                    the Navicomp processes the results. Unfortunately 
                    I have had to allow for the fact that you cheated 
                    at your eye tests.
                    
                                        RIMMER
                    (Sitting up) What do you mean, cheated?
                    
                                        KRYTEN
                    There's no point in lying sir. You crept in here 
                    last night, knowing you were going to have a 
                    medical, and you copied the eye charts onto your 
                    shoes.
                                        RIMMER
                    I admit I might have taken a peek, but I'm a 
                    competitive man Kryten, always have been. That's 
                    what makes me what I am.
                    
                                        KRYTEN
                    We're all perfectly well aware of what you are 
                    sir. Oh, the results. (Moves over to the panel, 
                    and returns with a small piece of card)
                    
                                        RIMMER
                    (Standing) Ah, everything tickedyboo?
                    
                                        KRYTEN
                    Would you like to take a seat for a moment sir?
                    
                                        RIMMER
                    (Sitting on the bench) Problem?
                    
                                        KRYTEN
                    You don't have any next of kin, do you sir?
                    
                                        RIMMER
                    No, they all died of heart attacks. And not just 
                    heart attacks - aneurysms, strokes, brain clots, 
                    you name it.
                    
                                        KRYTEN
                    Are you of the school that, when faced with bad 
                    news, prefers to hear that news naked and 
                    unvarnished, or are you of the ilk that prefers to 
                    live in happy and blissful ignorance of the 
                    nightmare you're facing.
                    
                                        RIMMER
                    Ignorance, every time.
                    
                                        KRYTEN
                    (Very cheerily) Congratulations sir! You've come 
                    storming through your medical with flying colours. 
                    See you next time.
                    
                                        RIMMER
                    Everything's OK then?
                    
                                        KRYTEN
                    Absolutely peachy.
                    
                                        RIMMER
                    I want to know, Kryten, if there's something 
                    wrong.
                    
                                        KRYTEN
                    If there were something wrong, sir, I would tell 
                    you.
                    
                                        RIMMER
                    Even if I'd asked you not to?
                    
                                        KRYTEN
                    Well no. In that case I would lie and tell you 
                    everything was absolutely peachy.
                    
                                        RIMMER
                    Kryten, I want to know, that's why I asked for a 
                    medical. Is there bad news?
                    
                                        KRYTEN
                    Lie mode cancel. Yes sir, I'm afraid there is.
                    
                                        RIMMER
                    (Half sitting up, clutching chest) I knew it. It's 
                    the headaches isn't it. And the heart palpitations 
                    and the blackouts and the chest pains and the 
                    voices. It's something to do with that isn't it?
                    
                                        KRYTEN
                    Sir, when you died you were recreated as a 
                    hologram and your exact personality was refined to 
                    an algorithm and duplicated electronically. If 
                    that algorithm contained a flaw, that flaw would 
                    be duplicated also.
                    
                                        RIMMER
                    Flaw?
                    
                                        KRYTEN
                    It's not common, but it's possible for a hologram 
                    to die.
                    
                                        RIMMER
                    Kryten, kindly get to the point before I jam your 
                    nose between your cheeks and make it the filling 
                    of a buttock sandwich.
                    
                                        KRYTEN
                    As a result of both genetics and environment you 
                    are particularly prone to stress-related nervous 
                    disorders, and your activities over the past 
                    couple of years have pushed your brain to, well 
                    frankly beyond breaking point. (RIMMER starts 
                    breathing heavily, and moves over to what looks 
                    like a deep sleep booth) Your T count, which is 
                    the hologrammatic equivalent of blood pressure, is 
                    higher than a hippy on the third day of an open 
                    air festival, and if you wish to avoid a gigantic 
                    electronic aneurysm, it is imperative that you 
                    start on a program of relaxation.
                    
                                        RIMMER
                    I see, and you thought that the best way for me to 
                    start this program of relaxation was to tell me my 
                    brains are about to explode. You've got the 
                    bedside manner of an abattoir giblet gutter.
                    
                                        KRYTEN
                    Here's what I suggest. Try and avoid all stressful 
                    situations. Spend more time in your hard light 
                    form and take a little exercise. And here (moving 
                    over to a cupboard), try these Chinese worry balls 
                    whenever you feel anxious or tense. (RIMMER looks 
                    at the balls suspiciously)
                    
                                        LISTER
                    (Entering) Hey, maybe some good news. Come and 
                    check it out. (Leaves)
                    
                                        RIMMER
                    Er, Kryten, I don't want the others to know about 
                    this. I want you to behave as if everything's 
                    absolutely normal.
                    
                                        KRYTEN
                    As you wish sir.
                    

          3    Model. Starbug approaching Simulant ship.

                    There she blows.
                    
                                        CAT
                    Logging onto the ident computer.
                    
                                        RIMMER
                    (Entering, standing by LISTER's chair) What's this?
                    
                                        LISTER
                    We've come across the simulant ship we totalled a 
                    couple of weeks back. We're gonna try and board it 
                    for supplies.
                    
                                        KRYTEN
                    Is that wise sir? The scan says the superstructure 
                    is highly unstable and could go at any time.
                    
                                        RIMMER
                    What if some of the simulants have survived?
                    
                                        CAT
                    There's an old Cat saying: "If you're gonna eat 
                    tuna, expect bones."
                    
                                        RIMMER
                    (Back in his own seat) There's an old human 
                    saying: "If you're gonna talk garbage, expect 
                    pain."
                    
                                        LISTER
                    Look, we'll take our chances man, OK?
                    
                                        RIMMER
                    No K. They're cybernetically deranged mechanical 
                    killing machines. Not content with blasting their 
                    ship out of the sky, you now want to go back and 
                    steal what remains of their belongings? That's the 
                    metaphorical equivalent of flopping your wedding 
                    tackle into a lion's mouth and flicking his love 
                    spuds with a wet towel. Total insanity.
                    
                                        LISTER
                    Look, ever since that refrigeration unit packed in 
                    we've had to live off a few pathetic handfuls of 
                    moss and fungi scraped off passing asteroids. I 
                    can't stand it any more.
                    
                                        KRYTEN
                    Well sir, are you really saying you'd rather have 
                    a psychopathic mechanical killer rip off your 
                    skull and play your frontal nodes like a xylophone 
                    than have another bowl of my nourishing space 
                    nettle soup?
                    
                                        CAT
                    Buddy, I'd hand him the sticks and hold up the 
                    sheet music.
                    
                                        RIMMER
                    Lister, they are simulants. Why on Io should they 
                    have food supplies?
                    
                                        LISTER
                    Because the ident computer says they do. Look,
                    stocked to the gills.
                    
                                        KRYTEN
                    (To RIMMER) It's true sir. Rogue simulants always 
                    carry large stocks of food supplies in order to 
                    prolong the torment of their torture victims. In 
                    some cases, they've kept subjects alive for over 
                    forty years in a state of perpetual agony.
                    
                                        RIMMER
                    If we wanted to live in a state of perpetual 
                    agony, we'd let Lister play his guitar. We don't. 
                    I say drive on.

                                        KRYTEN
                    (To LISTER) Sir, can't you see your behaviour is 
                    totally irrational?

                    saddle of the exercise bicycle in the women's gym 
                    will be discharged without trial? Hmm, I'm sorry 
                    sir, that doesn't quite get to the nub of the 
                    matter for me. (To LISTER) Sir, we have enough 
                    thistles and weeds and cultured fungus for you to 
                    scrum yourself stupid until the day you die. This

                    Lister, we'd be fools not to listen to him. When 
                    is he ever wrong? Alright, he may have a head 
                    shaped like an inexplicably popular fishing float 
                    but he does operate from a position of total logic 
                    and we'd be fools to ignore his sage council.

                    At least let me and Mister Rimmer go in your

                    There's something else. I didn't want to say in 
                    front of the Cat. (Quick shot of CAT) The reserve 
                    fuel tank got punctured when we crashed into that 
                    ocean moon. If we don't resupply, we're out of 
                    power, two, three days.

                    (Grinding) So let me get this straight. If we 
                    board that ship and get captured, we're finished. 
                    However if we board that ship and don't get 
                    captured, but the superstructure disintegrates 
                    around us, we're finished. On the other hand, if 
                    we board that ship and don't get captured and the 
                    superstructure doesn't disintegrate around us, but 
                    we can't find any fuel, we are in fact finished.

                    board that ship, even if it is on the brink of 
                    disintegration. Let's just pray the crew are 
                    rotting in Silicon Hell with all the photocopiers.

                    while we were away you get boarded by a rampaging

                    We can't actually use the bazookoids. They're for 
                    psychological reasons only. Look, the scan said 
                    that the superstructure is so unstable that even a

                    the rest of the discourse is conducted by those

                    our merry way, yeah? Actually, as far as psychotic 
                    deranged ruthless killer simulants go, you're a

               Behind the SIMULANT, RIMMER can be seen. He has spotted 
               an escape pod, and is trying to sneak into it. LISTER's 
               words are aimed at RIMMER, not the SIMULANT, who does 
               not realise this. His words become more desperate as 
               the conversation continues.

                    This is the personal log of Space Corps hard-light 
                    hologram Arnold J. Rimmer. Day 1: After landing, I 
                    ventured forth to explore the place I would be 
                    calling home for the next two thirds of a 
                    millennium. A desert planet, the only life forms 
                    the most basic single-celled protozoa, and me. 
                    Relationships would be difficult, but not 
                    impossible. I repaired to the pod, to appraise the 
                    supply situation. The pod had indeed been looted 
                    from a seeding ship. Among the supplies I found 
                    two strange devices, labelled "Eco-Accelerator 
                    Rockets". I held out little hope that they might 
                    improve my lot, but launched them anyway. For six 
                    days and nights the entire planet was wracked with 
                    storms, the like of which I had never witnessed 
                    before or since. Then, just as suddenly, they 
                    stopped. In just six days I had created my own 
                    world, lush and verdant. I had created 
                    "Rimmerworld". I was Adam, in my own Eden, and 
                    only one thing was missing, my own Jane. As I 
                    studied the pod's textbooks, my excitement grew. 
                    It seemed entirely possible for me to create a 
                    fully grown female clone, using my own DNA as a 
                    template. This of course created the most enormous 
                    moral dilemma. Technically, she would be my sister, 
                    and therefore unable to take me as her lover. 
                    After much soul searching, I reluctantly decided, 
                    "What the hell", I just wouldn't tell her. After 
                    months of careful nurture, the cocoon cracked. 
                    Something had gone hideously wrong - the clone was 
                    just an identical copy of me. I went back to the 
                    manuals, and tried again...

                    organic, not hologram. the 'H' is an affectation. 
                    Possibly it has become a symbol of power.

                    These deformed monsters are no sight for my 
                    concubines. My treasures of pulchritude, run 
                    along. (He gestures to one) Avert your eyes from 
                    her great beauty. (Uncovers her face, which turns 
                    out to also be that of RIMMER, and kisses her. She 
                    covers herself, and he clears his throat. We see a 
                    GUARD uncovering his face) Let the trial begin,

                    These three abominations stand charged on eight 
                    counts of gross deviancy. Not content with not 
                    looking like the true image, they flaunt freakish 
                    behaviour such as charm, bravery, compassion and 
                    (pauses) honour.

                    Enough of this heresy. At the stroke of dawn take 
                    them out and kill them. And when you've killed 
                    them, burn the bodies, then bring me the cold 
                    ashes on a silver plate, with a glass of chilled

                    society can evolve is through mutations in the 
                    gene pool. When there is no richness or variety, 
                    congenital disorders and inherited lunacy are 
                    commonplace. Who can forget the famously insane

                    then using a rope weaved from strands of this

                    when a guard comes in, using it as a trip wire, 
                    gets laid out, and we put Rimmer in the guard's
